 1. SCORE THE WINNING GOAL

 The game's all tied up:  Visitors 1, Home Team 1.  The attackers are
 on the threshold of your goal, and it looks like they'll score the
 winning point, unless . . . .  You see your chance, steal the ball,
 and reverse the play.  With brilliant footwork, you dribble the ball
 into the opponents' goal area.  A defensive back moves in to
 intercept, but you feint to one side and pass the ball to a
 teammate.  Now to reposition for a try at the goal on the return
 pass.  The goalie anticipates the maneuver and runs up to cover
 the goal, starting a rumble of excitement in the stands.  Tension
 builds.

 You expect nothing more than a ground pass from your teammate,
 but soccer is a game of surprises.  As defensive backs move in to
 tackle the ball, your teammate suddenly backs off and lofts it high
 over their heads, catching the defenders completely off guard.  The
 crowd's on its feet now; the rumble crescendos to a roar.  This is
 it!  Your beautiful once-in-a-lifetime moment.

 High into the air you jump, your body arching back as you lift
 your head to track the oncoming ball. For an instant you seem to
 hover in air, then suddenly jacknife [sic] forward, smack the ball
 perfectly with your forehead, and send it hurtling toward the goal.
 The goalie dives for it.  He misses.

 The crowd's screaming wildly, out of control.  Breaking through the
 police barrier, fans stream onto the field and lift you onto their
 shoulders.  You're a hero! You scored the winning goal!

 2. GAME PLAY

 OPTIONS

 ATARI 5200 RealSports SOCCER can be played by two players, by
 one player against the computer, or by the computer against itself
 (Auto-Play).  Single-player games and Auto-Play games can be
 played at skill levels from Beginning to Expert.  Halves can last
 from 5 to 45 minutes.  RealSports SOCCER is set for a 2-player
 game with 5-minute halves.  If you want to play with different
 options, change the Options Display (see Figure 1 on the following
 page).  Instructions are given in Section 3.  Options and skill
 levels are described in Section 5 and are summarized in the Game
 Select Matrix (Section 7).

       Figure 1 - Options Display

 OBJECT OF THE GAME

 Your object is to score points by maneuvering the ball past your
 opponents and into their goal.  You score 1 point for each goal.
 The team with the highest number of points at the end of the game
 wins.  A scorecard is provided in Section 8 to help you keep track
 of your wins and losses.

 When you're ready to start the game, press the START key on your
 5200 controller.  The soccer field and score digits will appear, as
 shown in Figure 2.

       Figure 2 - Start of a Game

 TEAMS

 Each team has 5 players:  4 fielders and a goalie or goalkeeper.
 Home Team players wear blue shirts; Visitors wear red.  (NOTE:
 Colors may vary with your television control settings.)

 The team in possession of the ball is the attacking team.  At the
 start of the game, the Visitors are the attackers and the Home Team
 the defenders.

 The computer controls all goalie moves.  You control one fielder
 with the 5200 controller or TRAK-BALL option while the computer
 controls the other three.  Instructions for using the controller are
 given in Section 3, USING THE 5200 CONTROLLERS.  See Section 4
 for TRAK-BALL information.

 When your team is attacking, you control the ball carrier (fielder
 with the ball).  In defensive play, the computer selects the fielder.
 You can switch to another fielder by pressing any one of the
 SWITCH PLAYER keys on the controller keypad (see KEYPAD
 CONTROLS, Section 3).  The controlled player is identified by his
 bright shirt.

 REFEREE

 As referee, the computer blows the whistle to call penalties, signals
 the end of the first half, and places balls for kickoffs and penalty
 plays.

 THE CLOCK

 As soon as you start the game, the clock at the top of the
 television screen begins counting down the seconds to the end of
 the first half.  At the end of the first half, it resets and counts
 down the second half.  There is no time-out between halves.

 THE PLAY

 At the start of the first half, the ball is placed on the center spot
 on the halfway line (Figure 2).  Home Team fielders (blue shirts)
 are on the left side of the line, Visitors (red shirts) on the right.
 The Visitors' center fielder starts the play by kicking the ball from
 the center spot.  The center may kick the ball to a teammate or
 move it toward the goal himself.

 Visitors attack the left goal (Figure 3) while the Home Team tries to
 intercept the ball and attack the opposite goal.  The defenders can
 intercept the ball as soon as it's kicked off the center scot.

 Except during the throw-in (see PENALTY PLAYS), fielders never
 touch the ball with their hands.  The ball is trapped (caught with
 the feet), kicked, and dribbled with the feet.  Players may also
 bounce the ball off their heads.  (See Section 3 for ball control
 information and Section 6 for game tips.)

       Figure 3 - Attacking the Home Team's Goal

 SCORING

 To score a point, a fielder must kick the ball past the goalie and
 into the goal.  The goalie defends the goal by catching or trapping
 the ball and kicking it upfield to a teammate.

 When a goal is scored, the ball is returned to the center spot and
 the team that did not score kicks off.

 SECOND HALF

 In the second half, the goals are reversed.  Home Team fielders
 take positions on the right side of the halfway line and attack the
 left goal.  Visitors are positioned on the left side of the line and
 attack the right goal.  This time, the Home Team kicks off.

 PENALTY PLAYS

 There are three out-of-bounds penalty plays in ATARI 5200
 RealSports SOCCER:

 * Throw-in
 * Goal Kick
 * Corner Kick.

 THROW-IN.  When one team dribbles or kicks the ball over a
 sideline, the other team throws it back into play at the point it
 went out of bounds (Figure 4).  The ball may be intercepted as
 soon as it's thrown in.  The computer positions the fielder for the
 throw-in.  You trigger the throw-in and control the direction and
 force of the throw with the 5200 controller (see BALL CONTROL,
 Section 3).

       Figure 4 - Throw-in Penalty Play

 GOAL KICK.  When the attacking team maneuvers the ball over the
 defending team's goal line (outside the goal), the ball is placed in
 front of the goal and the goalie kicks it upfield (Figure 5).  Either
 team can trap the ball when the kick is completed.  The computer
 completely controls the goal kick penalty play in all games.

       Figure 5 - Goal Kick Penalty Play

 CORNER KICK.  If the defending team moves the ball over its own
 goal line, the ball is placed in a corner near the goal and a member
 of the attacking team kicks it upfield to a teammate (Figure 6).
 Either team can intercept the ball when the kick is completed.  The
 computer positions your fielder.  You set the height of the kick,
 direct the ball, and trigger the kick with the controller (see BALL
 CONTROL).

       Figure 6 - Corner Kick Penalty Play

 3. USING THE 5200 CONTROLLERS

 For one-player games or Auto-Play, plug a 5200 controller into jack
 1 on the front of the console unit.  For two-player games, plug a
 second controller into jack 2 (see Figure 7).

       Figure 7 - Controller Connections

 KEYPAD OVERLAYS

 For your convenience, two keypad overlays are included with this
 game (Figure 8).  Slip the overlay tabs into the slots provided on
 the controller keypad.

 The left and right sets of buttons function identically.  It doesn't
 matter which set you use.

       Figure 9 - 5200 Controller

 KEYPAD CONTROLS

 Refer to Figure 8, Keypad Overlay.

 SELECT OPTION (*).  Selects the option to be changed.  The order
 of selection is:

 1. Play mode
 2. Minutes per half
 3. Computer play level.

 The option to be changed appears in red on the Options Display, as
 shown in Figure 7.  (See Section 5 for descriptions of the options.)

 CHANGE OPTION (#).  Changes the option.

 NOTE:  Before START is pressed, SELECT OPTION (*) and CHANGE
 OPTION (#) operate only on the left controller (plugged into jack
 1).  After START, these keys operate on both controllers.

 HOW TO CHANGE OPTIONS

 1. Press RESET to see the Options Display (Figure 1).

 2. The 2 PLAYER play mode option should appear in red.

 3. Press CHANGE OPTION (#) to change the play mode.  Note that
    the computer play level option appears when you change the
    play mode to 1 PLAYER or AUTO-PLAY.

 4. Press SELECT OPTION (*) to display the minutes per half option
    in red.

 5. Press CHANGE OPTION (#) to change the minutes per half.

 6. Press SELECT OPTION (*) to display the computer play level
    option in red.

 7. Press CHANGE OPTION (#) to change the computer play level.

 KICK Keys.  These four keys set different types of kicks, which
 are triggered by pressing the top red controller button.  A key
 remains set until another key is pressed.  If you do not select a
 KICK key, your fielder kicks a medium-high ball when you press
 the top red button.

  * LOW KICK (1).  Low, short kick for short passes and goal kicks
    at close range.

  * MED KICK (2).  Medium-height kick for longer passes and goal
    kicks.

  * HIGH KICK (3).  Long-distance kick.  Lofts the ball high into the
    air and covers ground.

  * GROUND KICK (0).  Sets a ground kick, duplicating the function
    of the bottom red controller button.

 SWITCH PLAYER Keys (4 - 9).  These six keys allow you to switch
 control from one fielder to another when your team is defending.
 Each time you press a key (any key), the computer lights up a
 different fielder.  SWITCH PLAYER keys do not select specific
 fielders and do not operate when a team is attacking.

 CONTROL STICK

 Use the control stick (joystick) to move your fielders around the
 field and control the ball (see Figure 10).  The control stick rotates
 360 degrees for maximum maneuverability.

       Figure 10 - Control Stick Moves

 SPEED CONTROL

 Fielders can move at three speeds:  walk, run, and run fast
 (Figure 11).  The further from center you move the control stick,
 the faster they move.  Center the control stick to stop.

       Figure 11 - Controller Speeds

 BALL CONTROL

 Trapping.  A fielder traps the ball when he touches it.

 Dribbling.  Push the control stick in the direction of the goal to
 dribble the ball down the field.  The further you push the control
 stick, the faster the ball carrier goes.  That's not all there is to
 it, however.  You must use evasive tactics to keep opponents from
 tackling (intercepting) the ball.  A few effective maneuvers are
 zig-zagging down the field, varying pace, switching direction
 suddenly, passing the ball to a teammate, and outdistancing the
 tackle.

 Intercepting.  You can intercept by trapping a kicked ball or by
 stealing a dribbled ball.  To steal the ball, run your fielder
 straight into the ball carrier (don't go around him), trap the ball,
 and dribble it toward your goal or pass it to a teammate.

 Passing.  Passing is an effective way to move the ball downfield
 and maintain control.  To pass the ball, move the control stick in
 the direction of your receiver and press the appropriate red kick
 button.

 Kicking.  Move the control stick in the direction you want the ball
 to go and press the red kick button (see KICK Keys).  A ground
 kick is good for short-distance passing, kickoffs, and some goal
 kicks (see GAME TIPS, Section 6).  Use a lofted kick for
 long-distance passing and most goal kicks.  (NOTE:  The faster
 your fielder moves when he kicks the ball, the further the ball
 goes.)

 Throw-in.  Using the control stick, direct the ball to a teammate.
 Press the top red controller button to make the throw.  The
 further from center you move the control stick, the more forceful
 the throw and the further the ball goes.

 Corner Kick.  Choose a KICK key.  Using the control stick, direct
 the ball to a teammate.  Press the top red controller button to
 make the kick.

 CAUTION!  Be careful not to kick the ball out of bounds on a
 corner kick.

 See also Section 6 for tips on ball handling and teamwork.

 4. TRAK-BALL OPTION (Future Accessory)

 ATARI 5200 RealSports SOCCER offers a TRAK-BALL option that may
 be purchased separately.  To play the game with a TRAK-BALL,
 plug the TRAK-BALL into controller jack 1 on the front of the 5200
 console unit.  Follow the instructions in Section 3 for changing
 options, switching players, kicking, and controlling the ball.

 For two-player games, you can use two TRAK-BALLS or a 5200
 controller and a TRAK-BALL.  Plug the second TRAK-BALL or 5200
 controller into jack 2.

 TRAK-BALL ACTION

 Move the TRAK-BALL with your hand.  Fielders move in any
 direction you move the TRAK-BALL.  The faster you spin the
 TRAK-BALL, the faster they go.  Press the red buttons to kick the
 ball.  (See your TRAK-BALL Owner's Manual for additional
 information.)

 5. OPTIONS AND PLAY LEVELS

 A summary of options is provided in the Game Select Matrix in
 Section 7.  Instructions for changing options are given in Section
 3.

 OPTIONS

  * Play Mode. One or two players or Auto-Play.  Auto-Play is for
    spectators or RealSports SOCCER players who want to study
    game techniques at various skill levels.

  * Minutes per Half.  Halves can be anywhere from 5 to 45 minutes
    long.

  * Computer Play Level(for One Player and Auto-Play).  Beginning,
    Novice, Intermediate, Expert.  Start at Beginning level.  Change
    the play level when the computer becomes easy to beat or you
    want to study faster, more expert games.

 COMPUTER PLAY LEVELS

  * Beginning.  Computer teams walk through games and respond
    slowly.  Teamwork is poor, ball control is loose.  In one-player
    games, balls are easy to intercept and pass, and goals are easy
    to penetrate.  Good level for practicing ball control, kicks, and
    strategy with minimum opposition.

  * Novice.  Computer teams are more energetic.  Teamwork is
    better, ball control is tighter, and interceptions are more
    difficult.  Goalies are more alert.

  * Intermediate.  The computer gives you plenty of trouble in
    one-player games at this level.  Games are fast, teamwork is
    good, and balls are hard to intercept.  Unless you're an
    experienced player, you'll have trouble holding onto the ball, let
    alone scoring.  Auto-Play games are exciting at this level.

  * Expert.  World Cup soccer.  The computer team would even give
    Pele trouble.  Recommended for expert ATARI 5200 RealSports
    SOCCER players and spectators.

 6. GAME TIPS

 KICKING A GOAL

 A straight kick into the goal will almost always be blocked by the
 goalie.  Try to position your fielder for a diagonal kick.  In Figure
 12, the ball carrier is centered to the goal and can kick the ball
 diagonally right or diagonally left into the goal.

       Figure 12 - Goal Kick Strategy

 Normally, it is easier to score goals with lofted kicks.  However, if
 the ball carrier is very close to the goal,, he can often sneak the
 ball past the goalie with a short ground kick.

 PASSING

 At Beginning and Novice skill levels, you may not be able to pass
 the ball directly to your receiver.  In that case, lay the ball in his
 path, close enough for him to overtake and trap it before
 opponents can intercept.

 At Intermediate and Expert skill levels, pass the ball frequently to
 prevent interceptions and maintain control of the ball.

 DEFENDING YOUR FOAL

 When the attackers are close to your goal, try to intercept the ball
 and pass it to your goalie.  He'll kick it upfield and move the play
 away from the goal.  Make the pass at close range with a short
 ground kick, but be very careful not to penetrate the goal and
 score a point for your opponents!

 WRAPAROUND

 When your team is defending, you can move your fielder off the
 side of the screen and "wrap around" to the opposite side.  This
 may put your fielder in a better position to intercept the ball.

 POPEYE

 BY PARKER BROTHERS

 OBJECT

 In this game, you're POPEYE!  And your goal is to catch all of
 Olive's hearts, notes, and cries for H-E-L-P before they hit the
 water and sink--or before Brutus, the Sea Hag, or some vulture
 knocks you over.  Each time you complete a round, you'll
 automatically proceed to the next--and more difficult one.

 SETTING THE CONSOLE CONTROLS

 1. Place the cartridge firmly into the cartridge slot.
 2. Plug one or two hand-held controllers into the controller jacks
    labeled "1" and "2."  Use the controller in jack "1" for a
    one-player game.
 3. Press the ON/OFF switch to ON.
 4. Press the "#" button on the keypad to choose a one or two-player
    game.  (NOTE:  For a two-player game, zeros must appear at the
    top, right-hand side of the screen, next to where "2 UP"
    appears).
 5. Press either the START button or a BOTTOM "FIRE" button on the
    controller in the "1" jack to start the action.

 THE HAND-HELD CONTROLLERS

 Use the joystick on the handheld controller to guide Popeye up and
 down stairs, and across the platforms.  Press either of the BOTTOM
 "FIRE" buttons whenever you want Popeye to punch bottles, hit the
 punching bag, knock out vultures, or grab his spinach.  With each
 press of the "FIRE" button, Popeye will swing his fist
 once.  NOTE:  holding down the "FIRE" button will not repeat this
 action.

 PAUSE BUTTON

 At any time during the game, if you wish to "freeze" the action and
 your score on the screen, press down the PAUSE button on the
 keypad.  To start again, simply press the PAUSE button.

 PLAYING

 When you begin each round, the number of Popeyes remaining is
 indicated at the top, right-hand side of the screen.  The first
 Popeye will appear on the left, topmost ledge as soon as you press
 the START button.

 In each round, Popeye must win Olive Oyl's affection by catching
 all of her hearts, notes, or cries for H-E-L-P, depending on which
 round you're playing, before they fall into the water and sink.
 But Brutus, the Sea Hag, and the vultures all do their best to
 knock Popeye over--Brutus with his fists, the Sea Hag with her
 fast-flying bottles, and the vultures with their good aim!  When
 any of them hits Popeye--or if any of Olive's tokens fall into the
 water and are not pulled out in time--you lose him and the next
 Popeye appears on the left, topmost ledge ready to try again.

 Spinach
   Throughout the rounds, Popeye's spinach will randomly appear in
   specific places on the screen (see "Spinach" section under each
   round).  Whenever you see it, move Popeye over to the spinach and
   press the "FIRE" button.  If you reach it in time, Popeye will
   change color and you'll hear the "Popeye Theme."  This is your
   chance to catch up with Brutus and knock him over.  If you do,
   you gain 3000 points!  In addition, if you catch any of Olive's
   tokens while the tune is playing, you receive DOUBLE THE SCORE
   FOR EACH.  Once Popeye uses his spinach in any of the rounds, it
   will not appear during that same round again.

 The Sea Hag
   You never know when this nasty ol' biddy is going to jump out
   from the side lines and pelt Popeye with a bottle.  But she'll
   only let one fly when she's on the same platform as Popeye.  If
   Popeye's not fast enough with his fists to punch the bottle, and
   it hits him, you lose this Popeye.  If you have a remaining
   Popeye, he will appear at the top of the ledge.

 SWEET HEARTS - ROUND #1

 Hearts
   In this round, you must catch all 24 hearts before they fall into
   the water and sink--and without being hit by Brutus or the Sea
   Hag.  Each time you catch a heart, a one will appear on the side
   of Popeye's house, located at the top of the screen.  Once there
   are 24 hearts, you'll automatically begin the next round.

 "Thru" Ledges
   As the round begins, Popeye appears on the left, topmost ledge.
   You may move Popeye off this ledge and land him safely onto the
   platform below.  Or you may move him in the opposite direction
   and he'll travel around to the other ledge.  You may move Popeye
   back and forth between ledges or off either side and onto the
   platform below at any time.  Brutus cannot walk on either of
   these ledges, BUT HE CAN JUMP UP AND KNOCK POPEYE OVER!

 Stairs
   On each platform, there are sets of stairs which Popeye and
   Brutus must use to move from platform to platform.  Use your
   joystick to guide Popeye up and down these sets of stairs.

 Spinach
   Popeye's spinach will randomly appear on the stairs to the left,
   either on platform #2 or platform #3.

 "Down" Ladder
   In the center of the screen, there is a ladder which connects
   platform #2 and platform #3.  Popeye is the only one who can use
   this ladder, and only to move down from the 2nd platform to the
   3rd platform.  However, Brutus can reach up or down the ladder
   and knock Popeye over.

 Punching Bag and Bucket
   You'll notice a punching bag and a bucket located near the
   center, topmost part of the screen.  Whenever Popeye jumps off
   the right "thru" ledge, he may punch the bag, causing the bucket
   to fall.  If Brutus is directly below it, the bucket will stop
   him in his tracks and you gain extra points. (See "Scoring"
   section.)

 LOVE NOTES - ROUND #2

 Notes
   Here, you must catch all 16 love notes before they sink into the
   water, and without being knocked over.  Once you've caught all 16
   notes, you'll automatically begin the next round.

 "Thru" Ledges
   In this round, the "thru" ledges are located on platform #2.
   Again, Popeye can move off the ledge and land safely onto the
   platform below, or he can move around to the opposite ledge.
   Brutus can also move about these ledges, but cannot travel around
   to the opposite ledge.

 See-Saw
   At the bottom, left-hand side of the screen, there is a see-saw.
   Whenever Popeye is on the 3rd platform he can jump off the ledge,
   land on the see-saw and bounce upwards.  If Popeye "grabs" onto
   Swee'Pea once he reaches the top, Popeye will land on platform
   #1, and you gain 500 POINTS!  If not, then Popeye will land on
   the platform #2.  However, when Brutus bounces on the see-saw, he
   will always land on the 2nd platform.

 Spinach
   Popeye's spinach will appear on the right-hand side of the 3rd
   platform.

 H-E-I-P! - ROUND #3

   This time, Olive Oyl is crying for HELP and Popeye must catch all
   of the letters:  H-E-L-P.  Each time you catch a letter, another
   rung is added to the ladder located in the center of the screen.
   When the ladder is completely built, you'll automatically return
   to Round #1, but at a greater difficulty level.

 Sliding Platform
   In the center of platform #1, there is a sliding platform.  When
   Popeye steps onto it, he'll be whisked to the other side of the
   mast.  This sliding floor moves in both directions, and Popeye is
   the only one who can use it.  If Popeye misses the sliding
   platform, he falls to the next platform.

 Vultures
   In this round, vultures may suddenly appear and swoop down at
   Popeye.  If you're quick enough, Popeye can punch each of these
   vultures and gain 1000 points for each one he clobbers.  But if
   not, the vultures will knock Popeye over and you lose him.  If
   you have another Popeye, he will appear on the top, left-hand
   side of the screen.

 Spinach
   In this round, Popeye's spinach will randomly appear on the
   right-hand side of the 2nd and 3rd platform.

 END OF ROUND

 The round ends once you've collected all of Olive's tokens.  As
 long as you have a remaining Popeye, you'll automatically advance
 to the next round.

 DIFFICULTY LEVEL PROGRESSION

 When you complete all of the first three rounds, you will begin
 again at round #1, but at a greater level of difficulty.

 The following things will happen as you advance from level to
 level:

 * The speed at which Olive's tokens fall will increase.

 * The Sea Hag's bottles will fly across the screen more often and
   at a faster rate.

 * Brutus will chase Popeye more closely and at a faster rate.

 END OF GAME

 The game ends when you run out of Popeyes.  To play again, simply
 press down the START button.  To play a two-player game, press the
 # button, then the START button.

 Two-Player Games
 In a two-player game, players alternate as Popeye.  The LEFT player
 goes first. Each player's score is displayed throughout the game.
 The first player's score is to the left; the second player's score
 to the right.

 * In a two-player game, when one player loses all his or her
 remaining Popeyes, he or she is out of the game.  The opponent,
 however, may continue to play as long as he or she has a remaining
 Popeye.

 SCORING

 The number of points for each heart, note, or letter caught depends
 upon which platform Popeye is on when he catches it.

 EXAMPLE:  If Popeye is on platform #2 when he catches any kind of
 token from Olive, you gain 300 points.  If he is on platform #4,
 the token is worth 50 points.

 Hearts, Notes, & Letters
 Platform #1 ........................  500 points
 Platform #2 ........................  300 points
 Platform #3 ........................  100 points
 Platform #4 ........................   50 points

 Punching Bottles ...................  100 points
 Punching Vultures .................. 1000 points
 Hitting Punching Bag ...............   30 points

   Platform #3 ...................... 2000 points
   Platform #4 ...................... 4000 points

 Bonus Popeye
   You'll receive a bonus Popeye after the first 40,000 points
   accumulated in the game.

 Double Points
   Remember:  You'll receive double the point value for catching a
   token or Swee'Pea, if caught while the "Popeye theme" is playing
   (after Popeye picks up his spinach).

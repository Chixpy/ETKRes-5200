 JR. PAC-MAN

 BY ATARI

 Insert the 5200 game cartridge into your ATARI 5200 SuperSystem so
 the label faces you and reads right-side-up.  Be sure the cartridge
 is firmly seated in the center slot of the console, but do not force
 it.  Then press the POWER switch on.  See your Owner's Manual for
 further details.

 KIDDING AROUND WITH JUNIOR

 I may be young, but I'm no baby!  I'm a star just like my folks,
 Pac-Man (tm) and Ms. Pac-Man (tm).  And I've got twice their energy!
 Come play with me!  We'll race around giant playgrounds.  We'll chase
 down magic candy and run from ghostly bullies who'll tickle me to
 death if they catch me.  My playgrounds are full of challenging mazes
 with corners and alleys to hide in.  I run faster than a speeding
 roller skate, ducking behind barriers, dodging those mean bullies.  I
 can even race from one side of a playground to the other.  That's a
 lot of ground to cover!  But I've got to play a lot harder than my
 folks to live up to the Pac-Man family name.  That's why this is a
 whole new game!

 GAME PLAY

 On the playground maze, Jr. Pac-Man runs like mad, eating every dot
 in sight while trying to avoid the four ghost bullies - Inky, Blinky,
 Pinky, and Tim.  You start the game with five turns, and lose a turn
 every time a bully catches Junior.  The game ends when you lose all
 of your turns.  Have Junior eat a power pill when the ghost bullies
 start closing in.  Suddenly, he's stronger than the bullies - they're
 running from him!  Be aggressive and get them!  When you gobble a
 ghost, the eyes float back to the re-incarnation chamber at the
 center of the playground.  There they are re-incarnated and emerge to
 chase Junior again.  Watch for a toy-shaped candy that tromps across
 the playground.  It turns every dot it touches into a bigger dot
 worth more points.  But have Junior eat it before it goes too far -
 it can destroy the power pills!

 USING THE CONTROLLERS

 Plug your 5200 controller firmly into jack 1 for one-player games.
 Plug a second controller into jack 2 for two-player games.  Use your
 joystick to joyride throughout the maze. Jr. Pac-Man moves in the
 same direction you move the joystick.  The maze scrolls when Junior
 moves to the left or right edge of the screen.

 GAME SELECTION

 When the cartridge is inserted and the POWER is switched on, the game
 selection screen will appear.  If you wish to see a demonstration of
 the game, just wait a minute or two and the game demo will
 automatically begin.   At the game selection screen, press the # key
 to choose between a one- or two-player game.  Press the * key to
 choose the skill level you desire.

 To START, PAUSE, and RESET a game:

 Press START to begin playing a Jr. Pac-Man game.

 Press PAUSE to freeze all game play.  Press PAUSE again to resume
 game play.  Press PAUSE and then START to start another game at the
 same skill level.  Press PAUSE and then RESET to return to the game
 selection screen.

 SKILL LEVELS

 When you graduate to each higher level, the playground is faster,
 tougher, and even more challenging than the one before.  At the game
 selection screen, use the "*" key to choose your skill level.

 HELPFUL HINTS

 * Don't let Jr. Pac-Man eat the power pills too early.  Wait until
   the bullies gain on him, then have him tease them toward a pill,
   quickly gobble it, and immediately chase them.

 * Have Junior eat as many dots as he can before he eats the power
   pills.  This gives him more clear paths for chasing bullies.  Dots
   worth 10 points slow Jr. Pac-Man down.  Dots worth 50 points slow
   him down even more.  So, when the bullies close in, have Junior
   dash into a clear path to outrun them.

 * Jr. Pac-Man turns corners faster than the ghost bullies.  When the
   bullies are closing in, have him make lots of direction changes to
   outrun them.

 * Get to know the bullies' personalities.  Each one is unique, and
   you can use that fact to your advantage.

 * Allow the toy candies to transform as many dots as possible into
   50-point dots.  But have Junior eat the candies before they destroy
   the power pills.

 * Pay attention to game sounds, such as the tromping sound of toy
   candies.  They'll clue you to what's happening in parts of the maze
   you can't see.

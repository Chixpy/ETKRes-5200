 STAR WARS(tm): THE ARCADE GAME

 BY PARKER BROS.

 OBJECT
 To score as many points as possible by destroying a relentless swarm
 of IMPERIAL TIE FIGHTERS, a barrage of deadly fireballs, and a maze
 of sinister laser towers before finally blasting the infamous DEATH
 STAR from existence.

 SETTING THE CONSOLE CONTROLS
 1. Place the cartridge firmly into the cartridge slot at the top of
 the Atari 5200 unit.
 2. Press the ON/OFF switch to ON.
 3. Then, choose WAVE (difficulty level) 1, 2, or 3 by pressing the
 corresponding number on the joystick keypad.
 4. Press the START button or the Fire buttons on the joystick
 controller to begin playing.

 THE JOYSTICK CONTROLLER
 Because this is a one-player game, plug the joystick controller into
 the jack labelled "1." The joystick operates like the flight controls
 of an X-WING FIGHTER. To gain altitude (fly upwards), pull BACKWARDS
 on the joystick. To dive (fly downwards), push FORWARDS on the
 joystick. To fly right or left, simply move the joystick in those
 directions. Press the lower Fire buttons on either side of the
 joystick controller to fire your PROTON TORPEDOES. Holding down the
 Fire buttons will not produce rapid fire succession.

 PAUSE FEATURE
 At any time during the game, you may "freeze" the action on the
 screen by pressing the PAUSE button on the joystick controller. To
 begin the action again, simply press the PAUSE button or the Fire
 buttons.

 PLAYING
 In this game, there are increasing WAVES of difficulty. Each WAVE
 features 3 Rounds (except for WAVE 1). The rounds involve: (1)
 destroying fireballs and shooting down TIE FIGHTERS patrolling the
 DEATH STAR, (2) blasting fireballs and the tops off of LASER TOWERS
 along the surface of the DEATH STAR, and (3) destroying fireballs
 while avoiding CATWALKS in the DEATH STAR's EQUATORIAL TRENCH. It is
 in this last round that you must also hit the MAIN REACTOR PORT on
 the floor of the TRENCH with a PROTON TORPEDO to destroy the DEATH
 STAR completely!
 You'll begin the game at WAVE 1, Round 1 with 9 energy shields. Each
 time you successfully complete a WAVE, you'll automatically advance
 to the next and more difficult one with your remaining number of
 energy shields--plus 3 additional energy shields (NOTE: the maximum
 number of energy shields you can have at one time is 9). When you
 lose all 9 energy shields, and are hit by a fireball, tower, or
 CATWALK, the game ends and you must begin again. MAY THE FORCE BE
 WITH YOU(tm).

 SHOOTING IMPERIAL TIE FIGHTERS
 Round #1
 The IMPERIAL FLEET approaches! Their mission--to protect the DEATH
 STAR at all costs. These TIE FIGHTERS are armed with deadly
 fireballs. It's up to you to blast as many TIE FIGHTERS and fireballs
 as possible in order to gain the most points. Each time a fireball
 impacts your ship, you lose 1 energy shield. Survive this round and
 advance to the next one with your remaining number of energy shields.

 BLASTING LASER TOWERS
 Round #2
 You've made it past the IMPERIAL FLEET and now you're streaking
 across the surface of the DEATH STAR. Suddenly, you're caught in a
 maze of sinister-looking LASER TOWERS that rise into the darkness of
 space. You'll have to do some fancy flying if you're to avoid hitting
 them with your X-WING FIGHTER. Set your sights on the tops of these
 towers as you fly by and try to blast them with your TORPEDOES. For
 each tower top you hit, you gain extra points. And by the way, keep
 an eye open for those deadly fireballs. They're still out there (and
 after your ship)! Destroy them for extra points, too. Each time a
 fireball hits your ship, or you hit a tower, you lose 1 energy
 shield. Survive this round and advance to the next one with your
 remaining number of energy shields.

 SURVIVING THE EQUATORIAL TRENCH
 Round #3
 Beyond the LASER TOWERS lies the DEATH STAR's EQUATORIAL TRENCH. Once
 you're in it, get ready to fly like you've never flown before! As if
 the attacking fireballs aren't enough, there are all sorts of
 CATWALKS to avoid as you speed through this narrow passageway. Fly
 over, under, and around them--just don't hit them. Each time you do,
 or if you're hit by a fireball, you lose and energy shield. Destroy
 fireballs along the way for extra points, or, better yet, USE THE
 FORCE(tm).
 When you've made it past all these CATWALKS, keep an eye on the
 TRENCH's floor. When you see the MAIN REACTOR PORT, let the PROTON
 TORPEDOES fly. Make a direct hit and DEATH STAR explodes! The REBEL
 BASE is once again safe from the forces of the EMPIRE. Survive this
 round and advance to the next WAVE with your remaining number of
 energy shields--plus bonus shields.

 END OF WAVE
 Each WAVE ends when you successfully complete all 3 rounds.

 WAVE SELECTION & PROGRESSION
 After turning the game ON, you may select WAVES 1 through 3 to begin
 playing by pressing the corresponding number on the joystick keypad.
 The WAVE number will appear in the upper, right-hand side of the
 screen. You cannot select WAVES 4 and up; you must survive WAVE 3 to
 advance to WAVE 4, and so on.

 ZENJI

 BY ACTIVISION

 SEEK THE SOURCE.

 Connect all maze elements, creating an unbroken, green path to the
 pulsating source.  Avoid desires and illusions, and carefully watch
 the time.

 BASICS:

 *  Insert cartridge with your Atari 5200 OFF. Then, turn your Atari
    5200 ON.
 *  Wait for on-screen instructions.
 *  Press the desired game variation number, 1-8.  Levels 1,3,5 and 7
    are for 1 player; 2,4,6 and 8 are for two players.  The higher the
    level; the greater the challenge.
 *  Press START to begin.
 *  Press RESET to return to the title screen.
 *  You begin with one active life, and four reserves.  The game ends
    when you have lived out all lives.
 *  Enter your initials beside your final score by moving the
    controller left or right.  When desired initial appears, press
    either lower side button.

 POINTS:

 Points are awarded whenever complete connection (ZENJI) is achieved.
 The less time you've taken, the more points you'll receive.  Touch a
 numbered square and receive a bonus of 100 points X the number.
 Also, a bonus life will be awarded with every other increase of
 10,000 points.

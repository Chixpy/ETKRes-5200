 INSERTING THE GAME CARTRIDGE

 To insert your ATARI 5200 game cartridge, hold the cartridge so the
 name on the label faces you and reads right-side-up.  Carefully
 insert the cartridge into the slot in the center of the console.
 Be sure the cartridge is firmly seated, but do not force it.   The
 POWER ON/OFF switch is located on the lower right side of the ATARI
 5200.  Press this switch to turn the power on after inserting your
 game cartridge.  See your Owner's Manual for further information.

 1. A WORD FROM COMMANDER CHAMPION

 Welcome, cadets, to Federation Field.  I'm Commander Champion, your
 space flight instructor.  You'll be stationed here for some
 intensive starship flight simulation and computer training.  When
 you've successfully completed your training mission, you'll win
 your Novice star and a commission in the Earth Federation's most
 elite fighting unit . . . the Star Raiders.

 We Star Raiders have a long, distinguished tradition of service to
 the Earth Federation and the Galaxy.  Since the year 2010 we've
 policed the space routes, enforcing freedom of space and peaceful
 coexistence of the solar systems.  thanks to the Star Raiders,
 there hasn't been a major space war since then.  Space trade
 flourishes and the Earth Federation prospers.

 Now, just as we're beginning to think peace will put the Star
 Raiders out of business, the Zylons . . . that rabble of half-life
 barbarians from Alpha Solar . . . turn to space piracy and
 terrorism.  Their object is to break up the Federations's space
 trade and weaken its influence in the Galaxy.  Space Security has
 issued "cease and desist" orders to no avail.  Zylon responds by
 hijacking our spacecraft and terrorizing starbases that harbor
 them.  They've pushed us to the limit.  Let's rid the Galaxy of
 this pest once and for all!

 Your mission is to SEEK OUT Zylon combat ships in every sector of
 the Galaxy and DESTROY THEM ON SIGHT.  For this job we've given you
 the ultimate in sophisticated fighter craft.  Your starship is
 equipped with high-power photon torpedoes, twin ion engines, and
 dual hyperwarp engines that transport you instantly to the furthest
 reaches of the Galaxy.

 Your computer instrumentation surpasses state-of-the-art.  It
 includes a Galactic Chart with real-time updating, Long-Range
 Sector Scan for pinpoint targeting, and the most advanced Attack
 Computer ever devised for locking on the target and homing in for
 the kill.

 How does your starship compare with Zylon spacecraft?  So far,
 Space Intelligence has profiles of three Zylon combat spacecraft:

 Zylon Fighter - Designed for high-speed attacks, these ships can be
 deadly at close range.

 Zylon Cruisers - These are patrol ships and attack only in self-
 defense.  But don't let their defensive posture fool you; they'll
 give you plenty of trouble.

 Zylon Basestar - Like our starships, Zylon basestars are equipped
 with shields to deflect photon torpedoes and can only be destroyed
 at close range.  These are probably the trickiest of the Zylon
 fighter craft.  Approach them with extreme caution.

     Zylon Fighter    Zylon Cruisers    Zylon Basestar

 Code name for this operation is WIPEOUT.  You'll be launched on
 your first WIPEOUT mission as soon as you win your Novice star.  To
 complete your mission, you must destroy all Zylon targets.

 In a pinch, you can dock at a friendly starbase to energize and
 repair your starship, but be prepared for trouble.  Once WIPEOUT
 gets underway, we expect Zylon to surround and attempt to destroy
 all starbases that harbor our starships.  Prevent this at all
 costs!  Remember, with every starbase destroyed, our position in
 the Galaxy grows weaker and the Zylon menace grows stronger.

 At the end of each mission, Mission Control will evaluate your
 performance and rate you on five factors:
 * Skill level (NOVICE, PILOT, WARRIOR, COMMANDER).
 * Number of enemy starships destroyed.
 * Amount of energy used.
 * Length of time taken to complete the mission.
 * Number of starbases destroyed.

 Promotions are based solely on ratings . . . there are no shortcuts
 to success in the Star Raiders.  You start as ROOKIES, but in no
 time at all you'll make ENSIGN and then PILOT.  After that the
 going gets rough.  Don't be surprised if your first Pilot mission
 ends with a demotion to GALACTIC COOK or GARBAGE SCOW CAPTAIN.
 This is a tough service!  But you've got the stuff to make it.
 Some of you may even be WARRIOR material.  We'll tell you if you
 are.  As for STAR COMMANDER, few ever make it, but who knows?  The
 next one might be you.

 Go to it and good luck!  Or as we say in the Star Raiders, "Shields
 up and lock on target."

 ==========================

 2. YOUR FLIGHT SIMULATION TRAINING

 Your flight training program teaches you how to pilot a starship,
 find and destroy the enemy, dock at a starbase to energize and
 repair your starship, and above all, survive in space.  The
 training sessions are coordinated with your manual, so be sure you
 read it thoroughly, cover to cover.

 In a minute, I'm going to show you your starship simulation chamber
 and we'll "lift off" into space.  Then you'll find out how to
 handle your 5200 controller, which controls every function of your
 starship (Section 3).  I'll check you out on the Speed Mode and
 Control Mode pushbutton controls (Sections 4 and 5) and teach you
 to use the following starship equipment:

 * Shields
 * Attack Computer
 * Galactic Chart
 * Hyperwarp Engines
 * Photon Torpedoes
 * Control Panel Display
 * Long-Range Sector Scan
 * Manual Target Selector
 * Tracking Computer
 * Subspace Radio.

 We'll discuss energy drain (Section 6) and what to do when your
 starship is damaged (Section 7).  Then you'll practice docking at
 a starbase to energize and repair your starship (Section 8).

 I'll explain how Mission Control rates your performance at the end
 of each mission and decides what rank to promote (or demote) you to
 (Section 9).  next you'll get a briefing on what to expect at the
 four skill levels:  NOVICE, PILOT, WARRIOR and COMMANDER (Section
 10).

 When you're ready for your first training mission, I'll give you
 step-by-step flight instructions (Section 11).  To win your Novice
 star you must complete your training mission with energy to spare
 and earn a rank higher than ROOKIE.

 After graduation, you will probably rise in rank pretty fast until
 you make PILOT.  Then it gets rough.  So be sure you pay attention
 to the lectures on SURVIVAL TACTICS (Section 12).  At the end of
 the manual we've provided a SCORECARD so you can keep track of your
 progress.

 That's the program.  Now follow me and I'll show you your starship
 simulator.

 STARSHIP SIMULATOR

 This is your starship simulation chamber.  It's as close to a
 starship as you will get until you earn your Novice star.  But
 don't underestimate it.  Down to the last detail, it's exactly like
 a starship.  We call it STAR CRUISER 7.

 Step inside and climb into the cockpit in front of the ATARI 5200
 console.  Insert the STAR RAIDERS cartridge, which contains the
 simulation program, into the console cartridge slot (see inside
 front cover for directions).  Now turn on the television, your
 window into space.  Turn up the volume so you can experience the
 audio as well as visual effects of space flight.

 Attach the keypad overlay to the ATARI 5200 controller and plug the
 controller into Jack 1 on the front of the console.  Your 5200
 controller is an exact duplicate of a real starship controller.
 It's an incredible device.  With this little controller in hand,
 you command every function of STAR CRUISER 7, from engines to
 photon torpedoes.

 Get ready for liftoff.  Buckle your seat belt and strap yourself
 into your G-force harness before we power on the simulator.  (G-
 force is the gravitational force to which a body is subjected
 during acceleration.)

 Ready?
 Power on by pressing the POWER switch on the 5200 console unit.
 When the ATARI logo appears on your screen, start the countdown: 5,
 4, 3, 2, 1, LIFTOFF!

 Star Cruiser 7 is launched into space when NOVICE MISSION flashes
 on the screen (Figure 1).  Stars and meteors whiz past your
 starship as you cruise forward at a comfortable speed of 12 metrons
 per second.  (Metrons per second is an Earth Federation unit of
 space-time for speeds above 186,000 miles per second, the speed of
 light.)

     MISSION" in the upper left corner.]

 ==========================

 3. USING THE 5200 CONTROLLER

 With the 5200 controller (Figure 2) you'll pilot Star Cruiser 7,
 control both Twin Ion and Hyperwarp engines, call up computer
 displays, track the enemy, fire your photon missiles, and dock at
 a starbase.  We'll take a look at the control stick (sometimes
 called a joystick) in a minute.  Now let's talk about control keys.

 CONTROL KEYS

 * START:  Brings up the Control Panel Display and starts the action
   (see Figure 4).  Use START to start a new mission at the same
   skill level.

   [Screenshot.  Nothing remarkable about it.]
   Figure 4 - START Starts the Action

 * PAUSE:  Freezes action temporarily.  Press again to continue.

 NOTE: if PAUSE is on longer than 8 minutes, the computer will cycle
 colors on the television screen to prevent "burn in" of static
 images.

 * RESET:  Resets STAR RAIDERS to the beginning at NOVICE MISSION
   skill level (see Figure 1).

 * GAME SELECT (#):  After powering on, press the GAME SELECT key
   (#) to change the mission skill level.  Thereafter, press RESET
   once before GAME SELECT to change the skill level.  Hold in GAME
   SELECT to cycle through the skill levels.

 This key functions as the CONTROL MODE key after you press START.
 We'll discuss the Control Mode in Section 5.

 * SPEED MODE(*):  Once you've pressed START, this key puts your
   starship into Speed Mode, discussed in Section 4.  This key has
   no function until you press START.

 CONTROL STICK OPERATION

 The control stick rotates 360 degrees and handles your starship
 with ease.  In the Fore View (forward view of space) the control
 stick operates as shown in figure 5A.  In the Aft View (back view
 of space) operation is reversed (Figure 5B).  You'll learn how to
 switch from Fore View to Aft View in Section 5 - CONTROL MODE.

     C. Thrust Rates

     Figure 5 - Control Stick Operation

 THRUST RATES

 Star Cruiser 7 can turn, climb, and dive at four different thrust
 rates, as shown in Figure 5C.  When the control stick is centered,
 your ship is at zero thrust.  The further from center you move the
 control stick, the more thrust you apply and the faster your
 starship moves.

 Try this:

 1. Select NOVICE skill level.

 2. Press START.

 3. Press the CONTROL MODE key (#).

 4. Press the SHIELDS key (6) to turn your shields on, maggot.
    SHIELDS ON appears momentarily at the top of the television
    screen.  Shields will protect your starship in the even you
    collide with a meteor during the following maneuver.

 5. Press the SPEED MODE key (*).

 6. Press the (0) key to stop your engines.

 7. Center the control stick.  When the stick is at zero thrust, it
    appears that stars are fixed and only meteors move.

 8. Push the control stick forward very slowly and start to dive at
    minimum thrust.  Increase thrust by degrees until you're at
    maximum.  Slowly return the control stick to center.

 9. Execute right turns, left turns, dives, climbs, and rolls at the
    four thrust rates until you can control Star Cruiser 7 with
    ease.

 FIRE BUTTONS

 Once you've pressed START you can fire photon torpedoes.  Press one
 or both of the lower red buttons on your 5200 controller and watch
 a photon torpedo travel toward the center of the television screen
 and disappear in the distance.  Photon Torpedoes are discussed in
 Section 5.

 NOTE:  The two upper red buttons have no function, so you can press
 the upper and lower buttons at the same time if you like.

 ==========================

 4. SPEED MODE

 When your starship is in Speed Mode, the keys on the keypad control
 the Twin Ion engines and regulate forward speed (Figure 6).  Each
 key sets a speed or velocity, expressed in metrons per second (V =
 X met/sec.):

     Speed   Velocity V
      Key    (met./sec.)
     -----   -----------
       0       V = 00
       1       V = 00
       2       V = 00
       3       V = 01
       4       V = 03
       5       V = 06
       6       V = 12
       7       V = 25
       8       V = 37
       9       V = 43

 Now try this:

 1. After START, press the SPEED MODE key (*).

 2. Turn up the volume on your television set.

 3. Press SPEED keys 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, and 0 in turn.  Notice that your
    engine sounds diminish and stars appear to move slower and
    slower as your speed decreases.

 4. Now press SPEED keys 6, 7, 8, and 9 in turn and notice what
    happens as you steadily increase speed.

     [Shot of the keypad overlay with the Speed functions
     highlighted.]
     Figure 6 - Speed Mode Keys

 ==========================

 5. CONTROL MODE

 When your starship is in Control Mode, all the number keys on your
 keypad operate starship equipment or program modes of operation
 (Figure 7).

     [Shot of the keypad overlay with the Control keys highlighted.]
     Figure 7 - Control Mode Keys

 Try this:

 1. After START, press the CONTROL MODE key (#).

 2. Press the AFT VIEW key (2):  AFT VIEW appears at the top of the
    television screen.  The Aft View is the view of space from the
    aft or back space window.  Stars and meteors appear to recede
    into the distance as your starship moves forward.

 3. Press the FORE VIEW key (1) to restore the Fore View of space
    (Figure 1).

 Now let's look at the starship equipment operated in Control Mode.

 SHIELDS

 Before you set out on a mission, press the SHIELDS key (6) and turn
 on your shields.  SHIELDS ON appears momentarily at the top of your
 screen and space looks blue.

 With shields on, your starship can never be destroyed by photon
 torpedoes or meteors . . . unless, of course, it hyperwarps into a
 meteor.  Without shields, it hasn't a snowball's chance.  At NOVICE
 skill level, shields prevent your starship from being damaged.  At
 all other skill levels, shields give protection but do not prevent
 damage.  (See Section 7 - STARSHIP DAMAGE for more information.)

 To turn off the shields, press SHIELDS (6) again.  SHIELDS OFF
 appears at the top of the screen and space looks black.

 ATTACK COMPUTER

 Your next move is to turn on your Attack Computer.  Press the
 ATTACK key (7).  ATTACK COMPUTER ON appears momentarily at the top
 of the screen, along with the target crosshairs and the Attack
 Computer Display (Figure 8).  In the Aft View, only the target
 crosshairs appear; there is no Attack Computer Display.

 Use the Attack Computer Display to track enemy targets (see PHOTON
 TORPEDOES), starbases (Section 8 - STARBASE DOCKING), and meteors
 (Section 12 - SURVIVAL TACTICS).

 To turn off the Attack Computer display, press the ATTACK key (7)
 again.  ATTACK COMPUTER OFF appears at the top of the screen.

     [Screenshot with the Target Crosshairs and Attack Computer
     Display labeled and the words "ATTACK COMPUTER ON" at the top.]
     Figure 8 - Attack Computer On

 GALACTIC CHART

 After turning on your shields and the Attack Computer, press the
 GALACTIC CHART key (4) to display the Galactic Chart and target
 data (Figure 9A).  The chart shows you the whole galaxy, divided
 into sectors.  Some sectors contain enemy spacecraft and friendly
 starbases; others are uninhabited.  Starbases are indicated by *;
 Zylon spaceships are identified as follows:

     xx
      xx
     xxxxx  =  patrol consisting of two enemy ships
      xx
     xx

       xxx

     xxx    =  task force of three enemy ships

      xxx

      xx

     xx xx  =  fleet of four enemy ships.

       xx

     [Screenshot with the Galactic Chart displayed.]
     Figure 9A - Galactic Chart

 MARKING THE TARGET

 Choose an enemy target sector.  With the control stick, move the
 cursor (+) from its position in the center of the chart to the
 target sector.  Note that a blinking ring (??) remains in the
 center.  The ring marks the sector you more from; the cursor marks
 the sector you move to.  (We like prepositions to end sentences
 with.)

 You can move the cursor from sector to sector at fast or slow
 speed, as shown in Figure 9B.

          /\

              _Stop
          -- /
            /
     <  | () |  > --Fast
              \
          --   \_Slow

          \/

     Figure 9B - Cursor Control Speeds

 * Slow:  Keep the control stick close to center.
 * Fast:  Push the stick as far as possible in the direction you
   want the cursor to move.
 * Stop:  Center the control stick.

 NOTE:  The cursor can "wrap" around the Galactic Chart vertically
 and horizontally.  For example, it can leave the Galactic Chart at
 the bottom and reappear at the top, or leave the chart at the right
 side and reappear at the left side.

 Which sector should you choose?

 A two-ship patrol is the easiest target to begin with, but there
 are other considerations:

 Warp Energy:  You must hyperwarp from sector to sector, and that
 uses up a lot of energy.  The further the target, the more energy
 you use.  In general, it is more economical to cover the Galactic
 Chart in short jumps.  We'll go into energy drain more thoroughly
 in Section 6.

 Enemy Position:  Zylon ships constantly shift sectors in an effort
 to surround and destroy starbases.  You will save yourself a lot of
 grief if you go after targets that are in dangerous positions, such
 as next to a starbase.

 STARBASE SURROUNDED

 Your subspace radio will flash STARBASE SURROUNDED on your screen
 when Zylon combat ships surround a starbase.  After the warning,
 you have 1 minute to clear enemy ships from a sector next to the
 starbase and save the base.  If Zylon succeeds in destroying the
 starbase you will lose a vital energy and repair port, and Zylon
 will build two new combat ships out of the starbase debris.

 Figure 10 shows the enemy positions required for a starbase to be
 surrounded.

        >

     =  *  =

        =  >

     Figure 10 - Starbase Surrounded

 NOTE:  THE ZYLON FLEET WILL ATTEMPT TO SURROUND AND DESTROY ONLY
 ONE STARBASE AT A TIME.

 The Zylons will shift sectors at different rates, depending on
 their size.  A patrol will move the fastest, a task force at half
 the speed of a patrol, and a fleet at approximately 1/8 the speed
 of a patrol.

 TARGET DATA

 When you have selected your target, read the target data under the
 Galactic Chart (Figure 11).

     [Screenshot of the Galactic Chart again, with the data at the
     bottom of the screen highlighted.]
     Figure 11 - Target Data

 WARP ENERGY:  Number of energy units required to hyperwarp to the
 sector selected.

 TARGETS:  Number of enemy targets in the sector selected.

 STAR DATE:  Elapsed time during a mission, measured in centons; 100
 centons = 1 minute.  The enemy may jump from one sector to another
 when the STAR DATE counter crosses .00 or .50.

 DC:PESCLR:  DC = Damage Control, P = Photon Torpedoes, E = Engines,
 S = Shields, C = Computer, L = Long-Range Scan, R = Subspace Radio.
 Status of the equipment is shown by the color of the letter:

     blue = normal
     yellow = damaged
     red = destroyed

 We will discuss starship damage in more detail in Section 7.

 HYPERWARP

 The HYPERSPACE key (8) turns on your Hyperwarp Engines, and
 HYPERWARP ENGAGED appears momentarily at the top of the screen.
 Before you activate your Hyperwarp Engines, however, be sure the
 Attack Computer is on.  You need the crosshairs for navigating in
 hyperspace and the Attack Computer Display for tracking targets.

 NAVIGATING IN HYPERSPACE

 At NOVICE skill level, you do not need to steer your starship.  The
 computer centers the Hyperwarp Target Marker in the crosshairs and
 keeps the starship on course (see Figure 12).

     [Screenshot with the Crosshairs and Hyperwarp Target Marker
     labeled.]
     Figure 12 - Hyperwarp Engaged

 At PILOT, WARRIOR, and COMMANDER skill levels, you must steer in
 hyperspace.  Using the control stick, keep the Hyperwarp Target
 Marker centered in the crosshairs.  A light touch on the control
 stick is recommended for steering.

 You must get the target marker centered in the crosshairs by the
 time HYPERSPACE or HYPERWARP COMPLETE flashes on the screen;
 otherwise you will be off course and out of your target sector
 Just before hyperwarp is completed, the engines reach peak velocity
 and volume.  Press the HYPERSPACE key (8) now and listen to the
 engines so you will recognize peak level when you're in hyperspace.

 NOTE:  The further the distance between sectors, the harder it is
 to stay on course in hyperspace.

 ENTERING A SECTOR

 When you enter a sector occupied by Zylon combat ships, the
 computer flashes HYPERSPACE and sounds the RED ALERT.  Note that a
 target marker, showing the position of the target relative to your
 starship, appears in the Attack Computer Display (Figure 13A).

     [Screenshot of Red Alert with the Target Marker labelled.]
     Figure 13A - RED ALERT

 When you enter a sector with a starbase in it, HYPERWARP COMPLETE
 flashes at the top of your screen and a target marker, showing the
 position of the starbase, appears in the Attack Computer Display
 (Figure 13B).

     [Screenshot of a Starbase Sector.  The Attack Computer Display
     has a starbase icon in it.]
     Figure 13B - Starbase Sector

 When you enter an empty target sector, HYPERWARP COMPLETE flashes
 on the screen but there is no target marker in the Attack Computer
 Display (Figure 13C).  Return to the Galactic Chart and correct
 your position.

     [Close-up shot of an empty Attack Computer Display.]
     Figure 13C - Empty Sector

 HYPERWARP ABORT

 If you're in hyperwarp when you get a STARBASE SURROUNDED message,
 abort hyperwarp and return to the Galactic Chart to see which
 starbase is in trouble.  To abort hyperwarp, press the ABORT (0)
 key.  When HYPERWARP ABORTED appears on your screen, press the
 GALACTIC CHART key (4).

 PHOTON TORPEDOES

 A photon torpedo is a burst of concentrated energy that can
 completely destroy an enemy spaceship, meteor, or another photon
 torpedo.  As long as you have energy, you never run out of
 torpedoes, but each time you fire, 10 units of energy are used up.
 If you hit another photon torpedo head on, 100 units of energy are
 used up (see Section 6 - ENERGY DRAIN).  Obviously, then, you
 should make each photon torpedo count and not fire randomly.

 Your starship is equipped with two torpedo launchers, on the port
 and starboard sides.  You can only fire one torpedo at a time,
 except when the Attack Computer locks your torpedoes onto the
 target; then the fire button launches both photon torpedoes
 simultaneously.

 Lock-on occurs when the target marker is centered in the Attack
 Computer Display and the horizontal (é) and vertical (è)
 coordinates in the Control Panel Display read +00.  In Figure 14,
 the lines labeled "A" show that the computer is locked on in the
 horizontal coordinate; those labeled "B" show that the computer is
 locked on in the vertical coordinate.  When the marks designated
 "C" appear, the computer is locked on in both coordinates and the
 target is within range.  This is the best time to fire; you have a
 90% kill probability at this time.

      ---------------
     Figure 14 - Target Locked On and Within Range

 NOTE:  Of course you can hit the enemy without locking on your
 torpedoes, but you use up more energy.

 When you hit a target (enemy ship, space object, or photon torpedo)
 it explodes into silver particles (Figure 15).  If your target is
 a Zylon fighter or cruiser, your hit destroys it and the computer
 credits you with a kill (see CONTROL PANEL DISPLAY).  If it's a
 Zylon basestar, a hit does not always destroy it.  Basestars are
 protected by shields and can only be destroyed by a direct hit.

 When an enemy ship hits your starship (with shields on), the screen
 flashes red and blue.  (Colors may vary with the settings of your
 television set.)  If your ship is damaged, DAMAGE CONTROL sounds a
 warning and flashes a message on your screen telling you what
 equipment has been damaged or destroyed (see Section 7 - STARSHIP
 DAMAGE).

 After you have wiped out all Zylon spacecraft in a sector, the
 target marker in the Attack Computer Display disappears.  Return to
 the Galactic Chart and select another sector.

     [Fore View Screenshot with a Zylon ship exploding]
     Figure 15 - Zylon Ship Hit

 CONTROL PANEL DISPLAY

 The Control Panel Display appears at the bottom of the screen in
 the Fore, Aft and Long-Range Views.  The display shown in Figure 16
 is interpreted as follows:

 V:12 -   Velocity is 12 metrons per second

 K:18 -   So far you have 18 kills to your credit.

 E:8260 - You have 8260 energy units left (out of 9999 units at
          mission start).

 T:2 -    The Attack Computer is currently tracking Target 2, which
          is a starbase; T:0 or T:1 would be an enemy target, and
          T:3 would be hyperspace.  When the Tracking Computer is
          on, T changes to C.

 é:+12 -  In the horizontal coordinate, your starship is off target
          by +12 gradons (see Note).

 è:+10 -  In the vertical coordinate, your starship is off target by
          +10 gradons.

 R:+236 - The target is 236 centrons in front of your starship (see
          Note).  If R were -236, the target would be 236 centrons
          behind your starship.

 NOTE:  Angles are measured in gradons (0 - 99 gradons).  Distance
 is measured in metrons; 100 metrons = 1 centron.

    [Screenshot with nothing to see but the Control Panel Display at
    the bottom.]
    Figure 16 - Control Panel Display

 LONG-RANGE SECTOR SCAN

 When there's a target marker in the Attack Computer Display but you
 can't seem to find the target, use the Long-Range Sector Scan
 (Figure 17).  Press the SCAN key (3).

    [Long-Range Scan Screenshot with your Starship, the Target, and
    the Target Destination labeled.]
    Figure 17 - Long-Range Sector Scan

 The Long-Range Sector Scan shows you a top view of the sector your
 starship is in.  In Figure 17, your ship is in the center and all
 objects in the sector rotate around it.  To use the sector scan:

 1. Select a target.

 2. Move the control stick to the left until the target is directly
    in front of you.

 3. Move the control stick forward or back, depending on the
    position of the target, until the target is as far above your
    starship as possible.

 4. Enter Speed Mode (#) and use your engines to approach the
    target.  Select a moderate SPEED key (3, 4, or 5).

 5. Minor course corrections may be needed as you approach the
    target.  Repeat steps 2 and 3 if required.

 6. When the target is very close to your starship, press the 0 key
    to stop the engines.

 7. The target should now be visible in the Fore View.  Press the
    CONTROL MODE key (#), then the FORE VIEW key (1).

 MANUAL TARGET SELECTOR

 When more than one Zylon ship is attacking, the Attack Computer
 decides which target to track and display.  The computer selects a
 target at random unless you are in a space duel, in which case it
 selects the target that is shooting at you.

 If you wish to select a different target, press the MANUAL key (9)
 to override the computer and call up the Manual Target Selector.
 Normally only two Zylons attack at the same time.  The Control
 Panel shows them as T:0 and T:1, target 0 and target 1.  If T:0 is
 displayed, pressing the MANUAL key automatically selects T:1 and
 vice versa.

 To return to automatic target selection, press the MANUAL key (9)
 again.

 TRACKING COMPUTER

 The Tracking Computer automatically tracks the selected target as
 it moves from fore to aft of your starship.  The television screen
 switches between Fore and Aft views as the Tracking Computer tracks
 the target.  Press the TRACKING key (5) to turn on the Tracking
 Computer.  COMPUTER TRACKING ON appears momentarily at the top of
 the screen and the Aft View is displayed.  To turn off the Tracking
 Computer, press the TRACKING key (5) again.  TRACKING OFF will be
 displayed at the top of the screen.  Note that if you switch off
 the Tracking Computer in the Aft View, you must press the FORE VIEW
 (1) to restore the forward view of space.

 WARNING!  This mode should be used by experience space pilots only.
 It is possible to get caught in the cross-fire of two enemy ships,
 one in front and the other behind your starship.  As they
 alternately fire at you, the computer will constantly switch
 between Fore and Aft views, so fast that only experienced Star
 Raiders are able to survive.

 SUBSPACE RADIO

 The Subspace Radio is used to update the Galactic Chart and relay
 the messages STARBASE SURROUNDED and STARBASE DESTROYED.  It also
 generates the TARGETS display below the Galactic Chart.

 ==========================

 6. ENERGY DRAIN

 Your starship has 9999 units of energy at the start of each
 mission.  Each operation drains some of this energy.  Note that the
 faster your starship travels, the more energy you use.  In terms of
 the tradeoff between energy drain and distance covered, speed 6
 (velocity = 12 metrons per second) is the most efficient speed.

               Operation                 Energy Drain (units)
    -------------------------------      --------------------

                          |     |     |     |     |     |

 The longer the hyperwarp jump, the greater the energy drain.  Jumps
 of five sectors or more are very costly.  If you must got a long
 distance, try to do it in several small jumps instead of one long
 jump.

 When energy falls below 1000 units, the Control Panel Display
 flashes a red warning.  You can refuel at any starbase provided
 your starship has the energy to get there.  See Section 8 -
 STARBASE DOCKING for refueling instructions.  If you run out of
 energy Mission Control will abort your mission and recall you to
 base.

 ==========================

 7. STARSHIP DAMAGE

 DAMAGE CONTROL flashes a message on your screen when any of these
 units is damaged or destroyed:

 * Photon Torpedoes
 * Twin Ion Engines
 * Shields
 * Attack Computer
 * Long-Range Scan
 * Subspace Radio

 In addition, the Damage Control indicator below the Galactic Chart
 (Figure 18) keeps track of equipment that is damaged or destroyed.

 DC = Damage Control, P = photon torpedoes, E = engines, S =
 shields, C = attack computer, L = long-range scan, and R = subspace
 radio.  A yellow letter means equipment damaged; a red letter means
 equipment destroyed.

    [Screenshot of the Galactic Chart with the data at the bottom of
    the screen highlighted.  Identical to Figure 11, except a few
    letters in the Damage Control indicator are yellow or red.]
    Figure 18 - Damage Control Indicator

 PHOTON TORPEDOES

 When your photon torpedoes are damaged, only one operates, but you
 can continue your mission.  When they are destroyed, your position
 is suicidal.  Get out of the target sector fast, find a starbase on
 the Galactic Chart, and hyperwarp to it for repairs.  (See Section
 8 - STARBASE DOCKING.)

 TWIN ION ENGINES

 Your engines will work when damaged, thanks to a backup impulse
 system however, progress will be slow.  If your engines are
 destroyed, your speed will be very slow and your starship will be
 extremely vulnerable.  You can, however, use the hyperwarp engines
 to move within a sector.  Press the 0 key and abort hyperwarp when
 you are close to the target (see Hyperwarp Abort in Section 5).
 Better yet, dock at a starbase for repairs.

 SHIELDS

 Shields will flicker when damaged, and the Control Panel Display
 and Galactic Chart will turn yellow.  If you take a hit when your
 shields have flickered off, you will be destroyed in a blinding
 flash.  Don't take chances.  When your shields are damaged, get out
 of the sector fast and hyperwarp to the closest starbase.  (See
 Section 12 - SURVIVAL TACTICS for some tips.)

 ATTACK COMPUTER

 When the computer is damaged, é, è and R in the Control Panel
 Display are lost.  When your computer is destroyed, all computer
 functions cease:  the Manual Target Selector and Tracking Computer
 do not function, and the target crosshairs and Attack Computer
 Display disappear.  It will be extremely difficult to steer in
 hyperspace and dock at a starbase without the crosshairs and Attack
 Computer Display, but you can do it.  See Section 12 - SURVIVAL
 TACTICS for help.

 LONG-RANGE SCAN

 Damage to the Long-Range Scan causes a mirror image of every object
 being scanned, and you will have to distinguish between the real
 object and its reflection.  Select a target and follow steps 2, 3,
 and 4 in the Long-Range Scan instructions (Section 5).  If the
 target moves away from you instead of toward you, it's the
 reflection.

 SUBSPACE RADIO

 If the Subspace Radio is damaged, the Galactic Chart will not be
 updated.  However, moving the cursor around the Galactic Chart will
 update the TARGETS indicator below the Galactic Chart and show you
 the number of enemy targets in each sector.

 If the radio is destroyed, you're in big trouble.  No starbase
 messages will be relayed, so you will not know when a starbase is
 surrounded.  Hyperwarp to a starbase and repair your radio at once.

 ==========================

 8. STARBASE DOCKING

 When your energy supply falls below 1000 units or your starship
 needs repairs, return to the Galactic Chart and find a starbase.
 Position the cursor in the center of the starbase sector (*).  The
 closer the cursor is to the center, the closer your starship will
 be to the starbase.  Engage hyperwarp by pressing the HYPERSPACE
 key (8).  If you are on-course when HYPERWARP COMPLETE flashes on
 your screen, a target marker should appear in the Attack Computer
 Display.  Proceed as follows:

 1. Center the target marker in the Attack Computer Display.

 2. Check the range (R) of the starbase on the Control Panel
    display.  You want the starbase in front of you, not behind you,
    so the range indicator should read +.  If it reads -, move the
    control stick toward you or away from you, as required, to
    change the range reading to a + value.

 3. Adjust your position horizontally.  Move the control stick right
    or left, as required, until the é coordinate in the Control
    Panel Display reads + or -3.

 4. Adjust your position vertically.  Move the control stick forward
    or back, as required, until the è coordinate reads + or -3.

 5. Bring the starbase within range.  Press the SPEED MODE key (*)
    and select an appropriate SPEED key, depending upon how far away
    you are.  Decrease your speed as you approach the starbase.
    When R is +000, press SPEED key 0 to stop your engines.

 6. When you have the starbase locked on, ORBIT ESTABLISHED should
    appear momentarily on your screen (Figure 19A).  If it does not
    appear, adjust your position and range slightly.

 7. When orbit is established, you will receive a message to STANDBY
    while the Transfer Vessel leaves the starbase and services your
    starship (Figure 19B).  When TRANSFER COMPLETE appears, your
    starship is ready to hyperwarp to another sector.  Re-enter
    Control Mode (#) and return to the Galactic Chart.

 NOTE:  If you hit a key or move the control stick before docking is
 completed, DOCKING ABORTED will appear on the screen.  Adjust your
 position and range, as required, to bring back ORBIT ESTABLISHED.

    [Screenshot showing your ship docked with a Starbase.  The
    Attack Computer Display shows the Starbase is locked on.]
    Figure 19A - Starbase Docking

    [Screenshot showing the transfer vessel (looks like a small car)
    leaving the Starbase.]
    Figure 19B - Energy Transfer

 STARBASE DESTROYED

 If Zylon destroys your starbase while you are attempting a docking,
 you will find yourself in enemy-occupied territory and under attack
 by two new enemy ships created from the starbase debris.  If your
 starship is in shape to fight, you can engage and destroy the enemy
 before you leave the sector.  The target marker remains in the
 Attack Computer Display after the starbase is destroyed so you can
 track the enemy.  If you're not in a position to fight your way out
 of the sector, re-enter Control Mode and return to the Galactic
 Chart to find another starbase.

 ==========================

 9. RATING

 A mission ends when . . .

 * You destroy all enemy targets and complete your mission.
 * You run out of energy and your mission is aborted.
 * Your starship is destroyed.

 No matter how your mission ends, you will receive a rating on your
 performance . . . a posthumous rating if your starship is
 destroyed.

 Mission Control bases each rating on the following factors:

 * Mission skill level
 * Number of enemy combat ships destroyed
 * Amount of energy used
 * Length of time taken to complete mission
 * Number of starbases destroyed.

 Here's the formula:

    M + 6(No. of enemy destroyed) - energy used/100 - Length of time
    taken/100 - 18(No. of starbases Zylon destroyed) - 3(No. of
    starbases you destroyed),

 Where M is a mission factor determined as follows:

    Mission     Bonus for   Mission     Penalty for
    Level       Completing  Aborted     Destruction
                Mission                 of Starship

    NOVICE      M = 80      M = 60      M = 40
    PILOT       M = 76      M = 60      M = 50
    WARRIOR     M = 60      M = 50      M = 40
    COMMANDER   M = 111     M = 100     M = 90

 Note that the formula penalizes you more for allowing Zylon to
 destroy a starbase than for destroying one yourself.  I'll have
 more to say about that when we study survival tactics in Section
 12.

 Your NEW RANK is displayed at the top of the television screen by
 rank and class.  There are five classes per rank, Class 1 being the
 highest and Class 5 being the lowers.

 If you do not score at least 48 points on a mission, your new rank
 will be GALACTIC COOK or GARBAGE SCOW CAPTAIN.  If you can't do
 better than that, your mission skill level is too advanced for you.
 Switch to a lower skill level and work you way back up.

    Rank             Mission Score
    --------------   -------------
    ROOKIE              48 - 79
    NOVICE              80 - 111
    ENSIGN             112 - 143
    PILOT              144 - 175
    ACE                176 - 191
    LIEUTENANT         192 - 207
    WARRIOR            208 - 223
    CAPTAIN            224 - 239
    COMMANDER          240 - 271
    STAR COMMANDER     272 - 303

 ==========================

 10. MISSION SKILL LEVELS

 Any time your rating puts you on a different skill level . . .
 NOVICE, PILOT, WARRIOR, OR COMMANDER . . . press RESET, then GAME
 SELECT (#) and change the skill level at the top of your screen.

 NOVICE LEVEL

 * 3 starbases
 * 9 enemy sectors with total of 27 enemy combat ships
 * With shields on, starship cannot be damaged.
 * Computer steers during hyperwarp.

 PILOT LEVEL

 * 4 starbases
 * 12 enemy sectors with total of 36 enemy ships
 * Starship can be damaged with shields on
 * Must steer during hyperwarp.

 WARRIOR LEVEL

 * 5 starbases
 * 15 enemy sectors with total of 45 enemy ships
 * Starship can be damaged with shields on.
 * Steering required during hyperwarp
 * Enemy attacks are faster and more devastating.

 COMMANDER LEVEL

 * 6 starbases
 * 18 enemy sectors with 54 enemy ships
 * Starship can be damaged with shields on
 * Steering required during hyperwarp
 * Constant attacks under very hazardous conditions.

 COMMANDER missions are only recommended for the most experienced
 Star Raiders.

 ==========================

 11. TRAINING MISSION

 This is it!  Time to solo.  Complete this training mission with a
 rank higher than ROOKIE to win your NOVICE star and full commission
 in the Star Raiders.  Here we go.

 1.  If required, press RESET and use the GAME SELECT key (#) to
     select NOVICE MISSION.

 2.  Press START.  Note that the Control Panel Display appears.

 3.  Press the CONTROL MODE key (#).

 4.  Press the SHIELDS key (6) to turn on your shields.

 5.  Press the ATTACK key (7) to turn on the Attack Computer
     Display.

 6.  Press the GALACTIC CHART key (4) to display the Galactic Chart.

 7.  Move the cursor to an enemy target sector.  A two-ship patrol
     is the easiest target to start with, but your first choice
     should be a target that is threatening a starbase.

 8.  Read the target data under the Galactic Chart.

 9.  Press the FORE VIEW key (1) to bring up the Attack Computer
     Display.

 10. Press the HYPERSPACE key (8) to engage your hyperwarp engines.

 11. When RED ALERT flashes on your screen, you've arrived in the
     target sector.

 12. Center the target marker in the Attack Computer Display.
     Remember that the best time to fire is when your photon
     torpedoes are locked onto the target.

 13. Destroy all enemy targets in the sector.  When there's no
     longer a target marker in the Attack Computer Display, you've
     completed your task in the sector.

 14. Return to the Galactic Chart, select another sector, and repeat
     Steps 8 through 14 until you've destroyed all the Zylon ships.

 REMINDER!  You have just 1 minute to rescue a starbase after your
 subspace radio flashes STARBASE SURROUNDED.  If you are in
 hyperspace at the time, abort (press ABORT or 0) and return to the
 Galactic Chart.  Select an enemy sector next to the besieged
 starbase and repeat steps 8 through 14.

 STARBASE DOCKING

 When the energy gauge in the Control Panel Display drops below 1000
 and the Control Panel flashes the red low-energy warning, hyperwarp
 to a starbase and energize your starship:

 1. If you're in hyperspace, press the ABORT key (0), then select
    the Galactic Chart.

 2. Move the cursor to the center of a starbase sector.

 3. Put your starship into the Fore View, then engage your hyperwarp
    engines.

 4. When HYPERWARP COMPLETE flashes on your screen and the target
    marker appears in the Attack Computer Display, you've arrived.

 5. Using your control stick, get the starbase in front of you (R =
    a + value) and correct your position until both é and è
    coordinates = + or -3.

 6. Press the SPEED MODE key (*).  Select the appropriate SPEED key
    and bring the starbase into range.  When R = +000, press the 0
    key to stop your engines.

 7. After establishing orbit, wait for TRANSFER COMPLETE.  Then re-
    enter Control Mode and return to the Galactic Chart to select an
    enemy target.

 RATING

 When your mission is ended, you'll receive your rating.

 Good news?
 Congratulations!  Prepare your dress uniform for graduation and
 receive your Novice star.  You are now a full-fledged member of the
 Star Raiders!

 Bad news?
 Don't be discouraged.  Some of the most famous Star Raiders didn't
 win their stars the first time.  Try again.  You'll do it next
 time.

 ==========================

 12. SURVIVAL TACTICS

 Here are some survival tactics that experience Star Raiders use to
 help them complete their missions and earn a promotion.  If you
 have a few tips of your own, tell your fellow Star Raiders.

 HOW TO MAKE A FAST RETREAT

 When your shields are destroyed, the next enemy hit will destroy
 your starship.  To get out of the sector fast, press the HYPERSPACE
 key (8) and hyperwarp out of the sector without consulting the
 Galactic Chart.  When you're safe in an empty sector, return to the
 Galactic Chart and locate a starbase.

 HOW TO REACH A STARBASE FASTER

 If you know there's a starbase next to an enemy sector you're in,
 you can hyperwarp directly to the starbase sector without using the
 Galactic Chart.  In hyperspace, move the Hyperspace Target Marker
 to the edge of the crosshair that points in the direction of the
 starbase.

 HOW TO FIND A STARBASE WITHOUT THE COMPUTER

 How an you find a starbase when your Attack Computer Display
 doesn't work?  Here's some help:

 Locate a starbase on the Galactic Chart and engage your hyperwarp
 engines.  As you enter hyperspace, note the position of the
 Hyperspace Target Marker and try not to stray from that position.

 When hyperwarp is completed, press the SCAN key (3).  If you're in
 the starbase sector, the starbase should be visible on the Long-
 Range Sector Scan.  If it is not, return to the Galactic Chart,
 correct your position, and try again.

 When you get the starbase on the Long-Range Scan, center it as
 instructed in Section 5, LONG-RANGE SECTOR SCAN.  Then press the
 FORE VIEW key (1).  The target should now be visible on the screen.

 LOW ON ENERGY?

 If your energy supply threatens to run out while you are trying to
 dock at a starbase, turn off your shields temporarily.  This will
 save 2 units of energy per second and may buy you enough time to
 establish orbit and energize your starship.  Don't forget to turn
 your shields back on before you hyperwarp into an enemy sector.

 WHEN TO SACRIFICE A STARBASE

 When you cannot save a starbase, it is better to destroy it
 yourself than let Zylon destroy it.  Mission Control doesn't
 penalize you as much when you destroy a starbase, because Zylon
 cannot use the starbase debris to build two new combat ships.

 NEED A LITTLE TARGET PRACTICE?

 After you destroy a starbase, the Attack Computer tracks meteors in
 the starbase sector, since there are no enemy targets to track.
 This gives you a perfect opportunity to practice homing in on the
 target and locking on the photon torpedoes (see PHOTON TORPEDOES in
 Section 5).  Meteors make good tracking targets because they never
 alter course.  Sorry, you do not get kill credits for zapping
 meteors.

 CONGO BONGO

 BY SEGA

 You're a hunter on a jungle safari. The jungle is full of
 creatures determined to give you a run for your life, but
 none of them can match the mischief of CONGO BONGO, the
 gorilla.
 The object of the game is to get even with CONGO while
 collecting as many points as possible. But watch your step...
 one slip and it's safari heaven!
 CONGO BONGO features:
 *ONE OR TWO PLAYER JUNGLE FUN
 *TWO TROPICAL 3-D GRAPHIC GAME SCREENS
 *MULTIPLE PLAY LEVELS OF INCREASING DIFFICULTY

 USING YOUR CONTROLS
 Then you turn the game on you see the CONGO BONGO logo screen
 with the high score. The screen changes and asks you to
 choose one or two players and if the game is controlled by
 joystick.
 "1" is pressed for one player game.
 "2" is pressed for two player game.
 When the joystick is used, player one uses the left control
 and player two uses the right control. The joystick is used to
 make the hunter walk or climb. The fire button is used to make
 the hunter jump.
 In a two player game the players take turns alternately.

 HOW TO PLAY
 THE SCREEN AND GAME PLAY- CONGO BONGO consists of two separate
 jungle scenes. Above the jungle scenes you see player scores
 and to the right of each score is the number of lives that
 player has left indicated by small hunters. Between each player's
 score is the player number, one or two. The bonus points and
 the play level are at the upper right corner of the screen.

 SCREEN #1
 The first screen takes you to Jungle Mountain. Here you try to
 reach CONGO BONGO at the top of his perch. You must climb up the
 mountain while avoiding the coconuts falling from the top of
 CONGO's perch. You lose one of your three lives when you:
 *GET HIT BY A COCONUT
 *FALL INTO THE WATER
 *FALL OFF A LEDGE
 *RUN OUT OF BONUS TIME
 When you jump across the chasm the cliff falls and you can't
 jump back.
 You then climb to Monkey Plateau. At the first level of play
 no monkeys jump on you. At the second level, one monkey can
 jump on you, preventing you from going farther. After the
 second level of play, two monkeys can jump on you and actually
 throw you over the cliff. To get the monkeys off your back, you
 must jump three times without moving directions.
 After you cross the river, avoiding the coconuts, you will reach
 CONGO's perch then automatically move to the next screen.

 SCREEN #2
 Now you've reached the Great River. Try to cross the lagoon on
 lily pads, by jumping on islands, hippos and fishes and once
 you've crossed, watch out for charging rhinos on the other side.
 Just as in screen #1, the jungle dangers increase as the play
 levels advance.
 1. The lily pads shrink each round.
 2. At the first and second levels th fish won't open their mouths
 to snap at you. At levels three and four only the two fish on
 the far right open their mouths. From the fifth play level up,
 all four fish open their mouths to snap at you. When you are
 on a fish that snaps you lose one life. The fish will warn
 you before they snap by changing the color of their heads to
 yellow.
 When you reach the other side of the river you have to watch
 for raging rhinos. When you reach the sleeping CONGO, you get
 to give him the hot foot he deserves. After a brief pause to
 enjoy your victory you automatically find yourself back at
 screen #1 but at the next, more difficult play level.
 On screen #2 you lose a life each time you:
 *FALL OFF A SHRINKING LILY PAD
 *GET EATEN BY A FISH
 *FALL OFF A FISH
 *GET HIT BY A RAGING RHINO
 *FALL OFF AN ISLAND
 *FALL OFF A HIPPO
 *BONUS TIME RUNS OUT

 SCORING
 Each step the hunter takes awards 10 points. Jumping onto a
 hippo, fish, or lily pad awards 100 points. Jumping across the
 chasm awards 500 points.
 Each screen begins with a BONUS amount that increases as play
 level increases.
 LEVEL         BONUS
 1             5000
 2             6000
 3             7000
 4             8000
 5-9           9000
 The BONUS is reduced every tick of the game clock. If the bonus
 is reduced to 0000 before reaching the screen end the hunter
 will run out of time and lose one life.
 The hunter has three lives per game. But if the total score
 reaches 10,000 points, one additional life will be awarded and
 the extra play screen will occur immediately.

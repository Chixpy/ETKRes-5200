 DOWN AND DIRTY!
 Reach miners trapped miles under the surface of the earth! Use
 the Prop-pack to maneuver through a maze of mineshafts! Blast
 vile vermin with the Microlaser Beam! Dynamite walls! Negotiate
 across the lethal lava flow! Rescue all the miners you can
 before running out of lives or power!

 GETTING STARTED
 *Insert cartridge. Turn power ON.
 *Press a number 1-5 to select one of the five one-player games.
 The higher the number, the greater the challenge.
 *To begin, press START and move Joystick.
 *RESERVES. Begin with one life in use and three in reserve.
 Acquire an additional life, to a maximum of six in reserve, for
 every 20,000 points earned.

 life remains, you return to the top of that level.
 *Game ends when you run out of lives.

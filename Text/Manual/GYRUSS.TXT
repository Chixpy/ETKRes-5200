 GYRUSS

 BY PARKER BROS.

 Three billion miles is a long way from home. But there's no shorter
 route from outer Neptune to Earth. As if that weren't enough...it's got
 to be a shoot-out all the way. You alone in your rapid-firing spaceship,
 swirling in a circular flight pattern...orbiting to the right...arcing to
 the left...trying to mow down wave after wave of enemy plane formations,
 rocketingmeteors and run-away satellites. Stops at Uranus, Saturn, Jupiter,
 and Mars will mark your progression towards Earth. Each one's a short
 visit, though. Then it's off again to the next planet--and the next wave
 of enemies. Reach Earth in one piece and maybe you'll think twice about
 leaving home. Then again...maybe not!

 SETTING THE CONSOLE CONTROLS
 1. Place the cartridge firmly into the cartridge slot on your game unit.
 2. Plug the joystick controllers firmly into controller jacks #1 and #2.
 For a one-player game, use the #1 jack.
 3. Turn the ON/OFF switch to ON. The title screen will appear showing the
 planet Earth.
 4. Press START to begin a one-player game. Press * to begin a two-player game.

 At any time during the game, you may press RESET to begin again. Also, you
 may freeze the action by pressing PAUSE. To restart the action, press PAUSE
 again.

 THE JOYSTICK CONTROLLER
 The joystick controls your spaceship's circular flight pattern through space.
 Simply move the joystick in a circular motion to do so. Press any FIRE button
 quickly to rapid-fire your spaceship's ammunition.

 OBJECT
 To make the journey from beyond Neptune to the sanctuary of Earth, defeating
 enemy planes, avoiding meteors and satellites, and reaching interim planets
 along the way.

 PLAYING
 At the start of the game, the screen shows:
 - your score in the upper center
 - the number of remaining spaceships in the upper left
 - the stage number in the right corner
 - your spaceship in the lower center

 Warps
 The first screen also tells you "2 WARPS TO NEPTUNE." A warp is one stage of
 battle against the enemy planes that guard the planets of your destination.
 It takes 2 warps to reach Neptune and 3 warps to reach each of the subsequent
 planets. There will be a brief pause between each warp at which time your
 spaceship speeds towards the next planet...and its next encounter. Also at
 this time, the screen gives you teh remaining number of warps to go.

 Enemy formations
 Within each warp you'll face FOUR different formations of enemy planes. The
 formations might emerge from the center of the screen where the planes band
 together--or form off screen where they can create a surprise attack. In either
 case, shoot down as many planes within the formation as you can and don't
 let them hit your own ship. Planes fire missiles, too...your only option is
 to avoid them...or be shot down.
 After the last formation appears, all the planes NOT shot down will regroup
 in the center and attack again. They will continue to do so until you've
 eliminated the last one--unless, of course, one eliminates you first.

 BUT PLANES ARE NOT ALL YOU NEED TO WORRY ABOUT. THERE ARE SWIRLING AND DEADLY
 SATELLITES AND METEORS, TOO.

 Satellites
 There are two types of satellites. One type appears in threes--two that look
 like giant molecules on either side of a glowing ball. Try to shoot them down
 for points. SHOOT THE MIDDLE SATELLITE, AND YOUR SHIP WILL FIRE DOUBLE
 BULLETS. THE SHIP WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO UNTIL IT GOES DOWN.
 Electromagnetic wave-emitting pairs are the other type of satellite. Shoot
 them down to break the wave that can cathc your spaceship and destroy it.
 And rack up points while you're at it!

 Meteors
 Meteors are a third type of enemy to watch out for. Meteors look like giant
 rocks and CANNOT be destroyed. So stay clear of them!

 COME OUT ALIVE AFTER COMPLETING THE TWO OR THREE WARPS NECESSARY TO REACH
 A PLANET, AND THAT PLANET APPEARS ON SCREEN. AFTER A BRIEF BREATHER, YOU'LL
 ENTER THE CHANCE STAGE.

 The Chance Stage
 The Chance Stage occurs upon reaching a planet. During this stage, you get a chance
 to rack up points. One at a time, four different enemy plane formations will
 appear on screen...BUT THEY HAVE NO POWER TO DESTROY YOU. SO position yourself
 for maximum firing accuracy. Bonus points are awarded for shooting down
 an entire formation and Super Bonus points for wiping out all four formations.

 WHEN THE CHANCE STAGE IS OVER, IT'S OFF TO THE NEXT PLANET AND THE NEXT
 BARRAGE OF WARPS.

 The Planets
 In case you need to be reminded...the planets along your journey through our
 solar system appear in this order: Neptune, Uranus, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars,
 and Earth.

 The Music
 You're listening to Johann Sebastian Bach's "Toccata and Fuge in D Minor."

 Bonus spaceships
 Score 60,000 points and you're awarded with an additional spaceship. Every
 100,000 points thereafter awards you another one.

 END OF GAME
 The game ends when you lose your last spaceship. If you should reach Earth
 with at least one remaining spaceship, you'll continue the game with Neptune
 as the first stop once again.
 To play again, press START for a one-player game; * for a two-player game.

 TWO-PLAYER GAMES
 In a two-player game, the left player goes first; players alternate turns.
 Your turn ends when you lose a spaceship.

 SCORING
 Points accumulate at the top of the screen throughout your turn.

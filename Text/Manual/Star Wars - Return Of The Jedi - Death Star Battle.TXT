 STAR WARS/RETURN OF THE JEDI: DEATH STAR BATTLE

 BY PARKER BROTHERS

 OBJECT
 Your ultimate goal is to destroy the sinister DEATH STAR before the
 EMPIRE completes its construction! But, reaching this powerful space
 station won't be easy. First, shoot down a restless swarm of TIE
 INTERCEPTORS as they pursue your ship, the MILLENIUM FALCON, across
 the galaxy. Then, with split-second timing, slip through one of the
 random openings in the DEATH STAR's energy shield! Blast as much of
 the space station away with your lasers as possible-while avoiding
 the destructive, heat-seeking DEATH RAY. Then, one quick shot to the
 DEATH STAR's energy core and POW! The DEATH STAR turns into an
 incredible burning mass, bursting into hundreds of blazing fireballs.
 And the heat's not off until you escape their fury! But if you do,
 then you're ready for another round with the infamous DEATH STAR!

 SETTING THE CONSOLE CONTROLS
 1. Place the cartridge firmly into the cartridge slot.
 2. Turn the ON/OFF switch to ON.
 3. You'll see the playing field displayed and the number "1"
 appearing at the bottom of the screen.
 4. Press the "#" button on the keypad to select a game number and
 difficulty level (See Game Selection Box).
 5. Press the START button to start the action

 THE HAND-HELD CONTROLLERS
 Use the joystick on the hand-held controller to guide your ship left,
 right, up, down, and diagonally.

 THE "FIRE" BUTTON
 To fire your lasers, simply press down either one of the bottom
 "FIRE" buttons on the joystick. Each time you press a button, your
 ship will fire one laser shot. To achieve rapid fire succession,
 hold down a "FIRE" button.

 THE PAUSE BUTTON
 At any time during the game, you may "freeze" the action. To do so,
 simply press the Pause button on the joystick controller. To continue
 the action, press the Pause button again.

 PLAYING
 Before pressing the START button to begin the game, you'll notice
 that the TIE INTERCEPTORS are flying away from your ship. They're
 heading back to the DEATH STAR in order to regroup for thr
 forthcoming battle. When you press the START button, your first of 5
 MILLENIUM FALCONS will appear in the lower, center portion of the
 screen. The remaining FALCONS are shown at the bottom of the screen.
 Try to shoot down as many TIE INTERCEPTORS as possible before they
 blast you with their lasers, or speed off and circle back for another
 attack. And keep a lookout for the ever-searching DEATH RAY!
 Eliminate TIE INTERCEPTORS and you'll notice random openings
 appearing in the DEATH STAR's energy shield. When the shield's
 outermost white energy band is deactivated and there is an opening in
 the shield, guide your ship through it. Upon penetrating this
 opening, you'll enter into hyper-space and arrive at the DEATH STAR.
 Fire your lasers at the DEATH STAR in order to knock out pieces of
 its outer wall. But beware of the DEATH RAY! It will track your every
 move, trying to destroy your ship. Eliminate as much of the DEATH
 STAR as possible (to maximize your bonus points), before you finally
 aim and fire on the energy core. When you hit it, be ready to outrun
 the explosion of fireballs before they reach your ship!

 THE DEATH STAR
 As the game begins, you'll see that the DEATH STAR is rebuilding
 itself piece by piece. If it is completed, all will be lost. The
 DEATH RAY will become fully operational and will destroy all of your
 remaining MILLENIUM FALCONS.

 TIE INTERCEPTORS
 Out-flying and out-shooting these IMPERIAL warriors is no small task.
 They approach your ship in droves, firing their lasers one after the
 other. If your ship is hit by their fire, you lose it. But if you
 blast them with yours, you gain 50 points for each one you shoot
 down. When the game is over, the TIE INTERCEPTORS head back to the
 DEATH STAR to regroup.

 THE ENERGY SHIELD
 This is what stands between you and the DEATH STAR! But penetrating
 it is not impossible-just tricky. You'll notice that at the edge of
 this shield there is a thin white band of energy. This band will
 intermittently appear and disappear. When it does disappear, and
 there is a black hole in the energy shield, guide your ship to the
 opening and slip through it. Beware! If you hit the white band while
 it is activated, you'll lose your ship.

 THE IMPERIAL SHUTTLE
 Aboard this shuttle rides a well known figure- THE DARK LORD!
 Eliminating this transporter won't be easy. But with the right moves
 and good aim, you can beat it at its own game! Randomly throughout
 the battle, you'll hear a "warning" sound. This means that the
 IMPERIAL SHUTTLE is approaching. If it collides with your MILLENIUM
 FALCON, your ship is destroyed. But one well placed laser shot to its
 upper body and you'll vaporize this SHUTTLE in its tracks! YOU GAIN
 1000 BONUS POINTS!

 THE DEATH RAY
 Always be on the lookout for the DEATH RAY! It's that small green
 shape that's continually moving about the DEATH STAR. While you're
 busy fighting off TIE INTERCEPTORS outside the energy shield, or
 knocking out pieces of the DEATH STAR itself, the DEATH RAY
 ruthlessly tracks you. If this evil ray strikes your ship, you're a
 goner!

 HYPERSPACE
 Hold on tight! Once you make it through an opening in the energy
 shield, your ship streaks across the galaxy to the DEATH STAR-now
 many times larger than it looked before!

 DESTROYING THE DEATH STAR
 Finally, your chance to rid the galaxy of this evil fortress! But
 keep your wits about you. There are still TIE INTERCEPTORS pursuing
 your ship. And there's the IMPERIAL SHUTTLE, too. Fire your lasers at
 the DEATH STAR's walls, knocking out as many pieces as you can. For
 each piece you hit, you gain 20 points. The more you knock out before
 you hit the energy core, the more points you gain when the fireballs
 start flying. Knock out all of the pieces, except the core, and you
 gain an extra MILLENIUM FALCON. Hit the core and the DEATH STAR
 becomes a glowing red mass with fireballs spewing out in all
 directions.

 FIREBALLS
 These fireballs are more than hot-they're DEADLY! It only takes one
 to blow your ship apart. But the trick is to avoid them for as long
 as possible. The longer you do, the higher your bonus points.

 ROUND PROGRESSION
 As you progress from round to round, the following will occur after
 each 10,000 points are scored:
 A. TIE INTERCEPTORS will fire more often.
 B. The DEATH RAY will seek more rapidly.
 C. The rate of construction on the DEATH STAR will increase.
 D. The number of openings in the energy shield will decrease.

 END OF GAME
 The game ends when you have lost all of your MILLENIUM FALCONS. To
 begin the same game again, press down the START button. To play
 another game, press the "#" button to choose a game number, then
 the START button to begin the action.

 TWO-PLAYER GAMES
 Games 2 and 4 are two-player games.
 The left player goes first; players alternate turns. Your turn ends
 when you lose all of your MILLENIUM FALCONS.

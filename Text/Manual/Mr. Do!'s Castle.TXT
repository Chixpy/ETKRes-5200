 MR. DO!'S CASTLE

 BY PARKER BROTHERS

 RULES - ATARI 5200 GAME SYSTEM / COLECOVISION GAME SYSTEM

 OBJECT
 To keep MR. DO! safe and moving to the next scene in his castle. To
 do this, help him eliminate as many unicorns as possible by either
 whacking them directly on the head with his hammer, or by hammering
 out floor blocks from above so they land directly on top of the
 unicorns.

 SETTING THE CONSOLE CONTROLS
 For Atari 5200 and ColecoVision Game Systems
 1. Place the cartridge firmly into the cartridge slot.
 2. Turn the ON/OFF switch to the ON position.
 3. Press the FIRE button once to begin the action.

 THE JOYSTICK
 Use your joystick to move MR. DO! through the castle. To make MR. DO!
 move left or right, move the joystick in those directions. To make
 MR. DO! climb up a ladder, push forwards on the joystick; to climb
 down, pull backwards.

 THE FIRE BUTTON
 Press the FIRE button any time you want MR. DO! to swing his hammer.
 You must press the FIRE button for each swing of the hammer.

 PLAYING
 This hammer-happy game begins as MR. DO! enters his humble home
 through the basement. With hammer in hand, he's ready to confront his
 invaders head-on. Guide MR. DO! up and down ladders, down hallways -
 even drop him off landings or through openings in the floor. But
 above all, keep him a safe distance from all the deadly unicorns.
 One bite and he's a goner!

 THE SCREEN
 In this game, there are 8 different scenes (or screens)- each one
 somewhere - in MR. DO!'s Castle. In each scene, there are 7 floors in
 the castle, including the top and basement floors.
 Atari 5200 Screen
 To the immediate right of the castle, you'll see a set of numbers and
 bars. The numbers on the top represent your score. The bars directly
 below these numbers represent the number of remaining MR. DO!'s. Each
 time you lose a MR. DO!, one bar will disappear from the screen.
 Also, each time you earn a bonus letter in the word "EXTRA," it will
 appear to the right of the screen.
 ColecoVision Screen
 To the immediate right of the castle, you'll see a set of numbers.
 These numbers on top represent your score. Beneath your score you'll
 see 5 flags. Each time you earn a bonus letter in the word "EXTRA,"
 it will appear on one of these flags. Finally, next to the flags
 you'll see small profiles of MR. DO!'s caps. These represent the
 number of your remaining MR. DO!'s.

 THOSE PESKY UNICORNS
 Whether they're red, blue, or green- these unicorns are all deadly.
 And they're all after MR. DO!. But there are a few things about each
 color unicorn you'll find helpful.
 Red Unicorns
 You'll meet these hot little guys first. But not to worry- you should
 have little trouble eliminating them. On levels 1 and 2, if any
 unicorns are standing on a block, you can whack them directly on the
 head with your hammer. Or, on any level, drop blocks onto them. Even
 slow them down by hammering them through openings in the floor once
 they've become trapped in a hole. The catch is: shortly after you've
 eliminated all but the last red unicorn, you'll hear a change in the
 background music and-POOF-he'll turn blue and double in number!
 (ColecoVision Only): If you hit red unicorns on the head too many
 times with your hammer, they'll turn into green unicorns!
 Green Unicorns
 You'll notice that green unicorns are a bit more feisty than red
 unicorns, though not as tricky as the blue ones. So be prepared.
 (ColecoVision Only): If you hit green unicorns with your hammer,
 they'll turn into blue unicorns!
 Blue Unicorns
 Blue unicorns are the nastiest of them all, and they're known to
 "clone" around. That is, they have the power to split into two
 seperate unicorns.
 One final note: blue unicorns are also a bit more hard-headed than
 the other color unicorns- which means you can't knock them through
 holes in the floors!
 Each time you eliminate a unicorn, you earn points DEPENDING ON THE
 NUMBER OF FLOORS THEY FALL THROUGH (see SCORING section). When you
 eliminate ALL unicorns in a particular scene, you automatically
 advance to the next scene.
 NOTE: On rare occasions, the unicorns may not find their way to MR.
 DO!  When MR. DO! proceeds to a different floor, however, they'll be
 back in hot pursuit!

 BONUS LETTER UNICORNS
 Unlike the rest of the unicorns in MR. DO!'s Castle, these critters
 run AWAY from MR. DO! instead of running after him. That's because
 you earn Bonus Letters for each one you clobber. When you've
 collected all 3 keys in a scene, AND reached the door at the top of
 the castle, the unicorns will change to Bonus Letters. In the next
 few seconds, clobber as many Bonus Letters as possible with your
 hammer or with falling blocks. For each one you eliminate, you'll
 earn the corresponding letter in the word "EXTRA." Spell EXTRA and
 you win an extra MR. DO! and advance to the next
 scene.
 NOTE: When time is up, Bonus Letter unicorns will change back into normal
 unicorns.

 MR. DO!'S CASTLE
 MR. DO!'S Castle is not your average home. But then, MR. DO! is not
 your average clown. In any case, as you move about the castle, you'll
 need to know the following things:
 Ladders
 For the most part, MR. DO! (and the unicorns) use the many ladders
 through-out the castle to travel to different levels. But the slanted
 ladders are the ones to watch. These ladders swing left or right
 whenever MR. DO! "kicks" them. Just guide MR. DO! over to the top of
 the swinging ladders. When his foot touches them, away they'll swing.
 You may want to swing ladders away from a particular floor when
 unicorns are hot on your heels!
 Floor Blocks
 You'll notice that there are 7 floors in MR. DO!'s Castle -including
 the top and basement floors- and that both MR. DO! and the unicorns
 can travel on any of them. However, the middle 5 floors (excluding
 the top and basement) are made of several blocks featuring different
 items. These items are:
 *Cherries- Cherries happen to be MR. DO!'s favorite treat. So, of
 course, his hallways are going to be filled with them. For each
 cherry block you knock out, you earn 20 points. Knock out all the
 cherry blocks in a scene and you'll automatically advance to the next
 scene.
 *Keys- Keys are definitely the key here! MR. DO! must knock out all
 the blocks featuring keys if he's to open the door at the top of the
 castle and earn a chance to win Bonus letters. For each key block you
 knock out, you earn 20 points.
 *Skulls- Skulls mean trouble for these troublesome unicorns. You'll
 notice that in some cases, there are skulls at either end of a
 particular section of a floor. If there are unicorns somewhere in the
 middle of that section, and you knock out BOTH skull blocks, the
 entire section will drop - and be replaced by a slatted bridge. This
 is a good way to eliminate several unicorns in one fell swoop. You
 earn 20 points for each skull block you knock out.
 *Unicorn's Blocks- When these unicorns fall into a hole in any of the
 floors, they like to fill it in (so they won't get trapped the next
 time around)! You can still knock out these blocks at any time,
 earning 20 points for each.
 Castle Door
 On the very top floor of the castle, directly in the center, you'll
 see a door. At the start of each scene, the unicorns will enter the
 castle from here. But when MR. DO!'s knocked out all the key blocks,
 the castle door will flash, meaning Bonus Letter unicorns are on the
 way. If MR. DO! reaches the door without being bitten, you'll earn
 bonus points- plus a chance to collect Bonus Letters!

 GAME DIFFICULTY
 There are 8 different scenes and 16 different Difficulty Levels
 within MR. DO!'s Castle- each more difficult than the one before. In
 general, as you progress through the various scenes, the following
 things will happen:
 *More unicorns will appear on screen.
 *Unicorns will become more aggressive.
 *Ladders and floor blocks will change positions.

 END OF GAME
 When you lose all of your MR. DO!s, the game ends. To play again,
 simply press the FIRE button. The game will begin at scene 1 and
 you'll receive 5 MR. DO!s.

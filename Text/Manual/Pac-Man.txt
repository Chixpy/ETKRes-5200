 the cartridge is firmly seated, but do not force it in.  The POWER
 ON/OFF switch is located on the bottom right side of the 5200 console

 1.  PAC-MAN COMES HOME
 ----------------------

 PAC-MAN has won the hearts of men, women, and children all over the
 world.  So, ATARI has created a PAC-MAN game for your ATARI 5200
 system.  This PAC-MAN game has all the excitement and challenge of
 the arcade game.  And now you can play it in the comfort and
 convenience of your home.

 Why, PAC-MAN and Shadow, the red ghost, even provide half-time
 cartoon entertainment.

 If challenge is what you're after, try playing the key game
 difficulty level.  And, if you're new to PAC-MAN, don't worry.  It's
 so easy to learn, you'll be a pro in no time.

 So relax, read on, and enjoy the game.

 2.  GAME PLAY
 -------------

 Keep PAC-MAN alive.  Guide him and guard him; protect him from the
 ghosts.  Gobble dots, energy pills, truit, bells, ATARI logos, keys
 and ghosts to score points.  Eat all the dots on the screen and the
 maze starts all over.  Score 10,000 points and earn a bonus PAC-MAN.

 The game starts with three PAC-MAN lives, which are indicated by
 three small PAC-MAN symbles at the lower left corner of the screen.
 When game play begins, PAC-MAN moves to the starting position at the
 center, close to the bottom of the screen.  Use the joystick to
 guide PAC-MAN around the maze.  As PAC-MAN passes over the dots, he
 gobbles them up and you score points (see SCORING).  Also in the maze
 are four large energy pills and four ghosts (see Figure 1).  The
 ghosts are out to devour PAC-MAN, but the energy pills give PAC-MAN
 the necessary power to gobble up the ghosts before the ghosts gobble
 him up.

 When PAC-MAN eats an energy pill, the ghosts turn blue with fright
 (see Figure 2).  PAC-MAN can then chase the ghosts and gobble them
 up.  But watch out, when the ghosts start blinking, run quickly;
 they're about to change back to their true colors.  The more ghosts
 you gobble up with one energy pill, the more points you score.

 For a tasty bonus treat, PAC-MAN delights in munching fruit.
 Cherries, strawberries, oranges, apples, and melons appear at the
 center of the screen (see Figure 1).  They only last a few seconds,
 so grab the fruit quickly to score bonus points.  After munching all
 the fruit, PAC-MAN can collect these other valuable bonus prizes:
 bells, ATARI logos, and keys (see SCORING, for the specific points
 you can score throughout the game).

 3.  USING THE 5200 CONTROLLERS
 ------------------------------

 Use your 5200 controllers with this ATARI game cartridge.  Be sure to
 plug the controller cables firmly into the jacks at the front of the
 5200 console.  Use jack 1 for one-player games, and jacks 1 and 2 for
 two-player games.  The player using jack 1 controls game selection
 and starts the game in two-player games.

 KEYPAD OVERLAYS

 For your convenience, two keypad overlays are included with this
 game.  Slip the tabs into the slots above and below the keypad on
 your controller (see Figure 4).

 GAME SELECTION

 Press * (1-2 PLAYER) to choose a one or two-player game.

 Press # (GAME LEVEL) to choose the game difficulty level you wish to
 play.  You can play PAC-MAN at the easiest level -- cherries -- or
 the most difficult level -- key -- or anything in between.
 Regardless of the level you start with, the game becomes increasingly
 more difficult with each new maze.  If you don't make a selection,
 the program automatically sets to the cherries level.

 GAME CONROL KEYS

 START
 Press START to begin a game.

 PAUSE
 Press PAUSE at any time to freeze the action.  Press PAUSE again to
 resume game play.

 RESET
 Press RESET to reset the game.

 CONTROLLING PAC-MAN

 Use the joystick to maneuver PAC-MAN up, down, right, or left around
 the maze.  Use the joystick to slide PAC-MAN in and out of the
 openings on either side of the maze (see Figure 2).  If PAC-MAN
 exits on the right, he re-enters on the left; if he exits on the
 left, he re-enters on the right.  But beware, the ghosts can travel
 these routes too!

 4.  GAME LEVELS
 ---------------

 You can start playing PAC-MAN at any one of eight game levels:
 cherries, strawberry, orange, apple, melon, ATARI logo, bell or key.
 Regardless of the game level you start with, you will automatically
 go on to the next level after PAC-MAN eats all the dots on the maze.
 All levels can be played by one or two players.

 The cherries level is a good choice for beginning PAC-MAN players.
 In this game, the ghosts move slowly and stay blue for a longer time.

 At certain points between game levels, PAC-MAN provides half-time
 cartoon entertainment.  We won't tell you exactly when the cartoons
 appear, but we will tell you to relax and enjoy the show.

 5.  SCORING
 -----------

 Scores appear at the top of the screen.  The score for player 1 is
 on the left; player 2 score is on the right.  The highest score is
 displayed at the center of the screen, and will continue to
 accumulate points until the 5200 console is turned off. (See Figure
 2 for highest score).

 Dot .............. 10 points
 Energy Pill ...... 50 points
 Cherry .......... 100 points
 Strawberry ...... 200 points
 Orange .......... 500 points
 Apple ........... 700 points
 Melon .......... 1000 points
 Atari Logo ..... 2000 points
 Bell ........... 3000 points
 Key ............ 5000 points

 First Ghost ..... 200 points
 Second Ghost .... 400 points
 Third Ghost ..... 800 points
 Fourth Ghost ... 1600 points

 6.  SURVIVAL TACTICS
 --------------------

 *  Novice PAC-MAN players should practice eating all the dots to
    clear the maze before trying to eat ghosts.

 *  Stay close to an energy pill before you eat it, and tease the
    ghosts into moving toward you.  When the ghosts get close, eat the
    energy pill and gobble up as many of them as you can.

 *  Use the side openings of the maze like escape tunnels.  Move to
    either side while quickly evading the ghosts.

 *  Use strategy, and try to save your energy pills until you
    absolutely need them.  When you are in a hurry, travel a route
    already cleared of dots.  You move 20 percent faster if there are
    no dots in your path.

 *  Look for patterns in the maze.  When you find one that works well,
    memorize it.

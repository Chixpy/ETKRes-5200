Beware!
I
live!""

This is a port of the Williams arcade game.

In the game, you must fly your ship about, shooting the floating asteroids to release Sinisite crystals. These crystals must be gathered to create Sinibombs. Also gathering crystals are worker drones. They are gathering crystals to build Sinistar, who wants to destroy the universe. As the workers will sometimes steal your mined crystals, feel free to blast them. Also flying about are warrior ships who want to blast you to protect the workers and Sinistar.

Once Sinistar is completed, he will announce 
Beware!
I
live!"
and
begin
chasing
you.
Hopefully
you
have
made
enough
Sinibombs
to
destroy
him.
As
he
chases
you
press
the
fire
button
to
release
Sinibombs
to
damage
him.
Once
he
is
completely
destroyed
you
are
off
to
the
next
harder
level."
